Salamalikum. After fajr prayer, I prayed to Allah that I wanted to meet my boyfriend in my dream, who lives in another country.I went to sleep right after fajr, I saw myself enter a room where his marriage was being celebrated. When he saw me he got up and welcomed me with the biggest smile ever, and his face was full of noor. His bride looked beautiful, but now that I was in the picture, their marriage ceremony was no longer to continue. I saw myself looking at the bride because I feel sad for her since she wasn’t gettin married to him anymore, she smiled at me and thats when I thought why is she smiling at me when im the one getting married to him now. I have never seen my boyfriend in a dream that felt so real…and that had such clear detailed quality.

wa `alaykum salam,

Allah is showing you through this dream that marriage is what brings lights, spirituality and perfected character but “girlfriend-boyfriend” is what bring darkness, sadness and death of the spirit. Convince this man to marry you and move into the nur!

I want to marry this girl my parents won’t allow because she’s from a different sub caste. I have no contact with this girl as she doesn’t want to talk to men and has allowed her parents to make her marriage decision, she is a doctor and I myself am a taxi driver does this make a difference

I asked guidence throw Istikhara about starting a new business.
I saw in my dream that its all dark and in the middle of no where up in mountains a person gives me a hat and there is something inside the hat. I feel in my heart that this particular  thing is of a great value and belongs to supernaturals and I have to return them.
I come home stand for prayer and pray sallah to ask Allah to help me return this thing to supernaturals, while in the middle of Sallah I put my hand on hat and feel that its empty and that thing has been returned to supernaturals. while I am in sajda I feel supernaturals all around me on my shoulder I feel the forces and their presence. but instead of being afraid I feel strong and I realize that my shoulders are broader than normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
","
It means through awliyaullah’s prayers your business will do well insha-Allah and your broadened shoulders are sign that you will be supported to carry the extra burden that entails. You will then “owe” the awliyaullah for their support and this can be returned by paying constant sadaqa to a charity which they run, such as a zawiya/khaniqa etc.

As soon as this is said mawlana disappears and the girl walks through the door I cannot remember the name or face.

A troubled marriage heavily burdened by evil eyes & black magic. A relation neither the happiest together or the happiest apart. In between not knowing what to do. Love no doubt is there, but negative emotions and outrage. Love so deeply that the fear of separation tears one apart, together is suffering and life is at stand-still when apart. Someone whom one can’t live with or live without. Years of not knowing what to do. I am weak in this matter & know not what to do. Guide me please, show me a way.

We are all sinners, and we are  all in need for forgiveness. Try to make at least 100 times  “Astaghfirullah” every day. For Waswas, Mawlana prescribes 40-100 times a  day “A`udhu Billahi min ash-Shaytaani ‘r-rajeem Bismillahi ‘r-Rahmani ‘r-Raheem “.

Salamalakum, sorry, I posted a question 2 days ago but fear i may have been too vague. My main point/question is that doing my ‘Allah’s’ specifally, invoking God, I cant understand why tariqas concentrate on one who ‘officially’/’doctrinally’ isnt God.
I seem to be able to do the full quota of ‘Allah’s’ whilst concentrating on Maulana, for a couple of weeks, then my my mind suddenly gets badly hung up on this point.
By the way, I was also wondering, If the Prophet (saws) is inside, and corresponds to/is ar-Ruh al-Muhammadiyya (S), am I correct in thinking that this corresponds to the ‘Self’ (of all ‘selves’) found in other religious doctrines? If so, are our duas addressed and answered by this Self (and therefore ar-Ruh?)

My husband passed away. He is survived by me, a daughter, mother and full siblings. I am owed a deferred dowry in the amount of 5000 LE. What is the share of each heir and what is the legal ruling for the deferred dowry?
","
The deferred dowry is a debt owed to the wife which must be fulfilled before the division of the estate and anything beyond this is considered an inheritance to which the heirs of the deceased, including his wife, are entitled. The estate is to be divided as follows:
• The wife receives one-eighth of the estate as an obligatory share.
• The mother receives one-sixth of the estate as an obligatory share due to the presence of an inheriting descendant.
• The daughter receives one half of the estate as an obligatory share because she is the only descendant and does not have a brother through whom she becomes a co-universal heir.
• The siblings receive the rest of the estate, each male receiving twice the amount of each female, as universal heirs since there is no other heir who has an obligatory share or a closer agnate.
The estate is divided into twenty-four fractions: the wife receives three, the mother four,
the daughter twelve and the siblings five, each male receiving twice the amount of each female. The estate of the deceased is divided as mentioned above if:
• The case is as mentioned in the question.
• There are no other heirs apart from those mentioned in the question.
• The deceased does not have an inheriting descendant who is entitled to an obligatory bequest.

1. There is a difference of opinion in the Hanbali school and many consider the right hand the more correct use. See Mardawi’s Insaf, Shinqiti’s Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni`. Majd al-Din Ibn Taymiyya (the grandfather) said it is Sunnah to use the right, but as for those who said to use the left no one said it is a Sunnah. As for the Shafi`i madhhab the consensus is that the Sunnah is the right hand.
2. When one pours the water on oneself in wudu‘ one begins with the hand (and toes) and ends up with the elbow (and heel), otherwise vice versa, when under a tap or when someone else pours the water then one begins with the elbow first.

As-Salaam aleikum,
It seems that the Divine Light (Nur) is slowly being removed from this world. Mawlana Shaykh also hinted at this in one of his sobhets when he declared that the Naqsibandi tarqiat is the only tariqat left who has Nur. All other spiritual movements are like “plastic cucumbers”.
Is it Allah’s will that the Divine Light is going away or is his Nur going away from the world because people believe less and less. In other words, can we as mere humans stop the disappearing of Nur or is this a futile exercise. I have heard that the Divine expands and subtracts his influence in this world and in his followers, so maybe the disappearing of Nur is just Allah ‘breathing in’.

In Islam Allah and His Prophet has the last word so it does not matter how dark it gets, as foretold by the Prophet (upon him blessings and peace) in so many hadiths pertaining to the end of times (see Mawlana Shaykh Hisham’s book Armageddon).

I do not know that saying. Some prophets lived up to a millennium such as Adam and Nuh, while others lived contemporaneously with one another such as Yaqub and his sons or Yahya and `Isa, and after the latter there were hundreds of years without prophets–upon our Prophet and all of them blessings and peace, so the saying that at the beginning of every hundred years comes a prophet does not appear to be accurate.

I’ve been with someone for 5 years, we were suppose to get engaged after he graduated school. He met my brothers and mother. After 2 and a half years he started to change out of nowhere. I’ve been loyal n very loving. I treat him like a king. We never fought or anything. Out of the blue he changed so we started to argue a lot. My intention was to marry this man. I love him so much. We broke up. Can you please help me get him back. I can’t read or write Arabic but I speak it very well. I have a pure heart for him and feel like he is suppose to be my husband.
Please help me.

Assalaam Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah Wabarakatuhu,
I am asking you for something with full of shame for myself.
I took baya online back in 2008 and a few years afterwards I faced a spiritual crisis (due to my ego and private problems in my life) to the extent that I virtually doubted my faith in Islam. However, I never took someone else other than Almighty Allah to be my Lord as I know there is only ONE GOD. But I did doubt Islam as my religion.
Today, I have the same problems but I honestly regret what I did. Now, I always read shahada and make salawaat to the Holy Prophet Muhammad Salallahou Alayhi Wassallam often. Insha Allah I will be forgiven.
Regarding Tariqa, I want to know whether my Baya with Mawlana Shaykh Nazim is still valid.
May Almighty Allah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad Salallahou Alayhi Wassallam bless you.

https://eshaykh.com/halal_haram/congratulating-non-muslims-religious-festivals/,"
Is it permissible to congratulate non-Muslims on their religious festivals like Christmas, Diwali, etc.?
","
God Almighty says, “God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes – from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, God loves those who act justly” (Quran 60: 8).
In Islamic law, there is no objection to congratulating and sharing peaceful non-Muslims their religious occasions that do not violate the fundamentals of Islam, especially if they are family members, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, etc. This is encouraged especially if they exchange congratulations with their fellow Muslims on the Islamic occasions as per the words of God Almighty, “And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet [in return] with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner]” (Quran 4: 86).
Exchanging congratulations with non-Muslims does not mean acknowledging their disbelief but is from among the forms of righteousness and justice that God Almighty loves.
A Muslim is commanded to speak good words and treat others kindly in a manner that is conducive to loving Islam and introducing its tolerant nature and comprehensiveness. God Almighty says, “And speak to people good [words]” (Quran 2: 83). He also says, “And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, “We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him” (Quran 29: 4).
As for the opinion of some scholars who maintain the prohibition of congratulating non-Muslims on their religious occasions, their prohibition only pertains to words which show acknowledgment of disbelief whether explicitly or implicitly, or to words that show acknowledgment of any of their invalid acts.
The ruling
Based on the above, congratulating non-Muslims on their occasions and accepting invitations to attend their celebrations do not necessitate acknowledging their disbelief or corrupt convictions.
And God Almighty knows best

ASA shaykh,
I have a huge problem, I recently had a reawakening of my deen and I took a hijab. When I got married I wasn’t a hijabi and when I decided to take the hijab my spouse didn’t object. It’s been two years Alhumdulillah that I have been wearing the hijab and began noticing my husband drawing away from me. I want to know if I should remove my hijab to continue to please my husband or maintain it because my heart doesn’t want to turn from the path I’ve taken to become a better Muslim. I’ve been told to remove it if it is causing martial problems. Please help guide me.

Hijab is not for husband. Unveil yourself in front of your husband. Sometimes when wearing hijab, hair may get smelly or sticky so avoid that as much as feasible and make your hair beautiful for him. Hijab is for going out, so don’t go out so much; this way you don’t have to wear hijab all the time.

I am sorry to be a trouble but my heart is not content with the query I  asked you. Remember I asked you if a person disrespects the Prophet (s)  how can we pray behind him? You had told me that  how do we know if he disrespected. I came across a query on eShaykh  which specifically lists that the Wahabi Imam  disrespects the Prophet (s) but he has been redirected to another  question which states that it is allowed. The URL in question is:
http://eshaykh.com/ibadat-worship/salat-prayer/salaat-behind-a-wahabi/
Could  you please check on this? I understood your clarification the other day  but I want to know if the response given to the questioner above was  accurate since my heart does not allow me to accept it.
Jazak Allah.

In particular, this questioner states:
Can you shed some light on praying behind a Wahabi who disrespects Nabi e karim Swallallahou Alaiyhi wassalam.The Wahabi doesn’t believe in hazir nazir etc…
Not believing in Hazir-Nazir is not necessarily disrespect. It might just be the way that imam was trained.
For example you told me Jazak-Allah. When you don’t add “al-khayr” at the end this means “may Allah punish as you deserve”. This is a mistake in training but your intention was undoubtedly good.
Shaykh Hisham writes, in the Encylopedia of Islamic Doctrine:
…it is known that Ibn `Umar prayed behind al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, who was a tyrant and shed the blood of the innocent. It is also known that Ibn `Umar prayed behind the People of Innovation such as the Khawarij. He used to say, “Salat is an excellent deed (hasana), and I don’t care who takes part in it with me,” and “whoever says, Hayya `ala al-Salat, I respond to him [with yes].” [This is related in Sunan al-Bayhaqi (3:121), al-Mughni (2:186-187) and elsewhere]…
I hope this clarifies this issue.

He gave me a B, which disappointed me in a way, but he said: “You’re good one” or he said: “Good, good.” – I can’t recall the exact words unfortunately.
May Allah swt reward you for your efforts inshaAllah.

Alaykum Salam,
A very good dream which shows encouragement and that you are on the right path with Mawlana Shaykh Hisham. “You’re a good one” is the manner of speaking of Mawlana Shaykh Nazim so your dream counts as seeing him also, as well as seeing those who took from both him and Grandshaykh.
B grade and disappointment might mean a number of things, such as
– encouragement and being “on the way” so as not to rest on your laurels;
– or encouragement to focus on your Shaykh without care as to who admires you and who disapproves;
– or a reminder that your shaykh is not Grandshaykh but rather his successor, so that next time if you see Grandshaykh you might say he is the shaykh of my shaykh you will get full grade;
– or a reminder that we do not work for grades or degrees, i.e. do not expect reward but rather lose yourself in your focus and care only for that. Allah knows best.

Assalam-o-Alaikum! Thank you for interpreting my previous dream!
On 6th of Shawal I saw myself buried alive in dream with a lagre cement slab placed over me. Many people are standing outside on my left hand side, some are laughing at me and making fun of me. Then a man comes running from my right side and says”stay away! Prophet(s) is coming to meet her”. They all run away, the slab slides away, Prophet(s) arrives and says “JIHAD, SHAHADA, SHAHEED“then He (s) hugs me and we start travelling beneath the earth. A window appears showing Muslims fighting with swords as if jihad has begun and they are all happy. Prophet(s) smiles at them.We continue travelling and talking to each other in Arabic.The dream ends then a voice tells me that  “today the time of your death has been decided”. Kindly tell me the interpretation of this dream. Should we all join the black flags arising from Khorasan?as Imam Mahdi(a.s) will be among them.
Allah bless you all!

wa `alaykum salam,
In dreams, death signifies life and seeing the Holy Prophet (upon him blessings and peace) is a big blessing that bodes spiritual acceptance, progress, and encouragement here and hereafter. Shahada and jihad point to struggle against the ego and Shaytan which laugh and scoff although they will be defeated, and travel points to a spiritual mi`raj and husn al-khatima that will be granted insha-Allah. This is a very good dream, congratulations.

Ya shaykh Hisham
I wanted to ask you what is “jalaal“. I read many awliya were very jalaal and had extremly jalaal eyes, such as Shaykh Sabir Pak qadassalahu sirru hul azeez and Shaykh Khalid al Baghdadi And Sayidina Abdul Qadir JILANI. Or they used to come into a state of jalaal.

wa `alaykum salam,
Jalal is complementary to Jamal, as Might and Power are to Beauty and Love. The Jalal and Jamal that manifested in the witnessing of the great Saints when that rank was manifest in them could overtake the beholder and result in being completely overwhelmed.

 I saw Maulana Shaykh Nazim Al-Haqqani in a dream that after the wudu he entered into the room and placed his feet on the towel to dry them, I got a chance to kiss his blessed feet, so I lowered myself like going into prostration and kissed his blessed feet, during this process I felt that Maulana saw me and he let me kiss his blessed feet. After that I gave that towel to my cousin to place on his face for the sake of blessings.

Good news for you Masha Allah. Mawlana’s feet represents the ability to stand firm with conviction on the straight path (siratul Mustakim). This means Allah (Subhanahu ta’la) will bestow you the strength of faith to stand firm on the right way by being a humble person throughout your daily life by following Mawlana’s footsteps. Also it means that the kisser (in this case you) will be honored with some responsibility according to your capacity. Perhaps to invite your family members and cousins to the way of the sufi people, the way of the people of zikrullah.

Asalaamualaykum wr wb knowledgeable eshaykh staff,
1. Is someone exempt from removing hair in certain areas if there is dry skin/excema there, so much so, that it burns to apply hair removal cream? If not, what alternatives are there for hair removal and what should one do about the excema?
2. What parts of the body need to be covered (for women) when reading the Qur’aan? Does it change if one is reading it inside the bed  ? (sorry if this sounds silly)
3. Is it true that any nawafil acts performed arent accepted if one still has qaza salaah‘s to make up?
4. I find it hard to perform rabitah. I have tried it with a picture of Madinah, Makkah and Mawlana Shaykh Nazim but the picture doesnt stay for that long. How do I improve this?
Thank You Very Much + May Allah Ta’la Reward You :)

wa `alaykum salam,
1) Get expert medical advise on the matter, especially if the eczema is a  serious one. They may offer various treatments, some of which may  not be that invasive.
2) All of a woman’s body are to be covered,  except for the face and two hands up to the wrists; and for Shafi`is,  including the feet.
3) There is an opinion to that point. There is also allowance that you may continue to do both, so you can.
4)  You are trying too hard. Just intend in your heart that you are in the  spiritual presence and awareness of the Shaykh, and call with Madad.  Keep on doing and do not give up, Insha Allah, you will be there.

As-Salaamu Alaykum to Mawlana Seyh Hisham Kabbani and Family and to Mawlana Seyh Nazim Qs Most of all. I heard from many jamaats of the Haqqani tariqa that once a mureed has Baya with Mawlana Seth, Mawlana Seyh has rights and watches over that mureed until end of his life. Day of Promises Seyh Nazim was present with all future and past Naksibendi mureeds is the reasoning for this. Is this true? Can a person be so bad with sin or so weak that they get kicked out of Tariqat by Seyh Nazim (Qs)? Forgive my adab please. If the person drinks or sins or learn from other Shuyukh can one be kicked out? JazzakAllah

Assalam O Alaikum brother,
Is there any way by which you can ask answer of your question to Allah (swt) or you can see in dream.
For example, if someone want to know if he is sick because of black magic or some serious sickness, how he can ask this question to God?
For example, if someone want to know which business he should start. How he can ask to God?
For example, if someone want to know what is intention of this or that person with you.
On your website you told us how we can ask Allah about our Wali Allah and also we can ask Allah to tell us cure for some incurable disease. They are also some kind of questions to the God.
I want to know how we can ask question to God about normal life.
I will wait for kind response

Thank you for the previous interpretation. Soon after the dream the person I mentioned defending wahabi position resigned to be the state minister of Islamic affairs. In this dream I saw Mawlana Sheikh Nazim. I kissed his cheek and his hand. When I leaned to kiss his cheek I saw large red pimples on his back and I thought what is wrong with Maulana. Despite this he does not seem to be suffering. Then I sat in front of him. We were all alone.

Insha-Allah people will be saved from that one’s harm.
What you saw were not pimples but the Seal of Sainthood. As the Prophet (s) had the Khatm an-Nubuwwah on his back, so too does each Seal of Saints in his time, as a Warith Muhammadi, Muhammadan Inheritor.

She says she got this ability from her father.I have seen this once,she does wudu,sits down in quiet place & calls on the Jinn by reading something.Then Jin comes into her & talks in her voice to the other person/s.The father also did the same thing & he claimed that Jins that came upon him were bazurg Jins and the family of these Jins go back to Jins that brought Iman on Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. The father was a pious person, read namaaz,read durood sharif a lot, he has also gone to Baghdad to visit the mazars of Aulias there. They don’t do any business with this Jin thing. Please advise correct path?

These individuals are in delusion and heading for danger. As for saying that “Jins brought Iman on Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him” it is blasphemy of the Qur’an and unbelief. Allah is our refuge from such ideas.

`alaykum as-salam,
It means:
– loyalty to the pact made on the Day of Promises and certainty in the Divine Promise that none dies on pure monotheism and belief in the next life except the Divine Promise of safety for them will be realized on the Day of Resurrection (Ibn Battal and Ibn Hajar, Sharh al-Bukhari and al-Khattabi as quoted in Subul al-Salam);
– my contract (`ahd) with You and my promise (wa`d) to You that I do and will ever believe in You and obey You. (al-Baghawi, Sharh al-Sunna; al-Munawi, al-Taysir Sharh al-Jami` al-Saghir).
The `Ahd of Allah is also His Qur’an, which contains His Wa`d.
The morning before Badr the Holy Prophet (upon him blessings and peace) kept saying: O Allah I ask you your `Ahd and Your Wa`d until Sayyidyna Abu Bakr (Allah be well-pleased with him) took him by the hand and they went out. And Allah knows best.
