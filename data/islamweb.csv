				Assalaamu alaykum. Please do not refer to other questions. It takes me about 10 times to pronounce the letter âAayn correctly in Surah Al-Faatihah and the Tashahhud when I am praying by myself. It is often replaced with 'hamza'. Shall I keep repeating it till I get it correct, or shall I proceed?

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
This is clearly a case of Waswaas (obsessive whispers); hence, we advise you to ignore such whispers and give them no attention whatsoever. Read the letter once, and do not repeat it, no matter how much the devil whispers to you that you did not pronounce it correctly.

				Assalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu. I recently read many of your fatwas in regards to certain disturbing subjects, such as incest, and many others, and brothers and sisters admitting to committing these sins. It made me realize as I read that our ummah is in a horrific state, engaging in some acts that are filthy and are not part of our history. Could this be seen as a punishment from Allaah, The Exalted, for us not adhering to what is from the Qur'an and sunnah as a nation? May Allaah bless you.

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
First of all, we ask Allaah guidance and chastity for the whole of our nation. We cannot authoritatively assert that what you mentioned is the cause of these calamities, but by not adhering to what is in the Quran and the Sunnah, Allaah may punish the people who do so with misguidance and deviation. Some righteous predecessors said, ""The sign of a good deed is a good deed after it, and the sign of a bad deed is a bad deed after it."" The evidence about this is in the Quran; Allaah says (what means): {And when they deviated, Allaah caused their hearts to deviate.} [Quran 61:5] Allaah also says (what means): {In their hearts is disease, so Allaah has increased their disease.} [Quran 2:10]

Shaykh Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Majmooâ:
âAbandoning the obligation [waajib] is a cause for committing what is forbidden; Allaah says (what means): {And from those who say, 'We are Christians,' We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We caused among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection.} [Quran 5:14] This is a text about them abandoning some of what they were ordered to do, and when they had abandoned it, this was a reason for the occurrence of enmity and hatred that are forbidden; this is a proof that abandoning the waajib (obligation) was a reason for committing what is forbidden, such as hatred and enmity.â
Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah   also said:
âActing according to the requirement of the knowledge (that one has acquired) makes that knowledge confirmed in oneâs memory [in a way that one does not forget it] and it makes it firm, but acting contrarily to oneâs knowledge weakens that knowledge; rather, this may make one forget it all; Allaah says (what means): {And when they deviated, Allaah caused their hearts to deviate.} [Quran 61:5] Allaah also says (what means): {And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it the first time. And We will leave them in their transgression, wandering blindly.} [Quran 6:110] Allaah further says (what means): {But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith]. And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. And We would have guided them to a straight path.} [Quran 4:66-68]â 
Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah   also said:
âAmong the ways with which Allaah punishes the people for their sins is when guidance and beneficial knowledge are taken away from them; Allaah says (what means): {â¦and their saying, âOur hearts are wrappedâ. Rather, Allaah has sealed them because of their disbeliefâ¦} [Quran 4:155]; Allaah also says (what means): {And what will make you perceive that even if a sign came, they would not believe.} [Quran 6:109] In another verse, Allaah says (what means): {And when they deviated, Allaah caused their hearts to deviate.} [Quran 61:5]â
Among the treatment for this is what follows: the students of knowledge should be active in enlightening the people about their religion and making them understand it, and they should make targheeb (encouraging people to do good by mentioning Allaahâs promises and rewards) and tarheeb (warning people from evil by mentioning Allaahâs threats and punishments) with the texts of the revelations and clarify the benefits of obedience and the danger of committing sin to the people. Ignorance and abandoning enjoining good and forbidding evil are the most serious causes of the spread of sins and immorality, and these are the reasons for the punishment of Allaah. Allaah says (what means): {And fear a trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively, and know that Allaah is severe in penalty.} [Quran 8:25] 
The Prophet   said, âWhen people see an oppressor but do not prevent him from doing evil, it is likely that Allaah will punish them all.â Another narration reads: âIf acts of disobedience are done among any people and they do not change them even though they are able to do so, then Allaah will soon smite them all with punishment.â [Ahmad, Abu Daawood and At-Tirmithi and Ibn Maajah - Al-Albaani classified it as Saheeh (sound)] 
The Prophet   also said, âWhen zina (fornicatiion/adultery) and riba (interest) become rampant in the people of a town, they themselves invite the Punishment of Allaah.â [At-Tabaraani and others - Al-Albaani classified it as Saheeh]

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
1. Dear brother, it is forbidden to bow oneâs head to honor any anthem, whether for a Muslim country or a non-Muslim one. Bowing the head in this case, is similar to performing Rukooâ, which is especially for Allah and must not be performed to anything else. This is why Islam forbade bowing the head in greetings.
Anas   narrated that a man said to the Prophet : âO! Prophet of Allah one of us encounters his brother or friend, does he bow for him? He said: âNo.â The man said: 'Does he honor him by kissing him?' The Prophet   said: âNoâ. Then the man asked: âSo, does he take his hand and shake hands with him? Thereupon, the Prophet   said: âYesâ.â [At-Tirmithi Ibn Maajah, and Ahmad]
2. The Muslim should stick to performing righteous deeds and avoiding evil and bad deeds in Ramadan and during his entire life. Doing this is more desirable in Ramadan because of its sacredness. The Muslim in this month does as many good deeds as he can. He performs all obligatory prayers in the mosque, prays many voluntary prayers, reads the Quran, gives alms, spends many nights awake worshipping Allah and observes Iâtikaf (staying in the mosque for the purpose of worship) in the last ten days of Ramadan if he can.
The Muslim should avoid all forbidden matters: (backbiting, tale-bearing, listening to music, looking at forbidden mattes in Ramadan and in his entire life).
Drinking, eating, having sexual intercourse and all other matters that annul the fasting are forbidden during daytime in Ramadan for the fasting person.
3. As for your third question please refer to Fataawa 81355 and 81443.
4. If any of your friends deals in Riba (interest and/or usury), you should advise him, remind him of the dangers of Riba and its bad consequences. Try to convince him to repent to Allah and to only take the capital money and return all the Riba (interest).
Remind your friend of the reward that one gets from giving good loans (free of interest). In fact, their reward is half that of giving alms. Ibn Masâood, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet    said: âNo Muslim gives two loans to another Muslim but gets the reward of giving one loan as alms once.â [Ibn Maajah]
In addition giving loans to needy people is part of making life easier for them and whoever makes something easy for a needy person, Allah make things easier for him in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. Indeed Allah helps the servant as long as the servant helps his brother.
5. Abandoning the prayer is a major sin. It is even a form of disbelief that takes the person out of the fold of Islam. This is the opinion of the majority of the Companions of the Prophet   and the Taabiâis (the generations that followed that of the Companions.)
It is narrated in a Hadeeth that the person who gives up praying will be resurrected on The Day of Judgement with Qaroun, Pharaoh , Haman  and Ubay Ibn Khalaf. [Ahmad]
As for his being dragged 40 feet in earth before being buried, we do not have any evidence for that.

				Assalamu aleykum dear brothers! My question has to do with the timing of the Friday ghusl. As it is known there are 3 views concerning this: taking Friday ghusl on Thursday evening after Maghrib prayer, taking ghusl on Friday after athaan of Fajr and the third one is taking ghusl after dawn.Sheikh Useymin (may Allah have mercy upon him) says that the most preferrable is the third view (after dawn) because it joins all other views. Now my questions: 1) which is the most correct view based on daleel? 2) is friday ghusl taken on thursday night, i.e. after maghrib valid? 3) if actually the third view is the most correct one, then based on that view if anyone takes ghusl in the evening on Thursday after Maghrib or after athaan on Fajr is his/her friday ghusl valid in this case 4) if it is not difficult for you could you quote the opinion of sheikh al-Albaani in this matter, i.e. timing of friday ghusl if there is any? May I Allah be pleased with you for answering the questions. As Salamu Aleikum

How does revelation happen in the case of the sunnah and in the case of the customs already present among the Arabs? Jazaak Allahu khair

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and messenger.
 
Indeed, Arabs had adopted a set of virtuous manners which Islam polished, approved what is praiseworthy, and perfected those which lacked perfection thereof. The Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âVerily, I have been sent in order to perfect good manners.â [Maalik and Ahmad]
Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means): {Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination.} [Quran 53:3] Ibn âAbbaas   commented on the verse saying, âThe verse means that as far as the revelation of the Quran is concerned, the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, did not speak out of his self inclination.â 
At-Tabari   wrote, âThe verse underlines that the Quran is a divine revelation and not the words of the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam; it is a divine inspiration sent down by Allaah â¦â 
Thus, it is known that the verse does not mean that all that the Prophet   spoke of was divine revelation which he received from Allaah. Rather, it means that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, was infallible in terms of the divine message which he delivered. However, this was not the case concerning his own personal views which pertained to matters that are open to Ijtihaad (personal reasoning).
For example, the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, once passed by the people who had been busy in artificially pollinating the date palm trees. Thereupon, he, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âIf you were not to do it, it might be good for you. (So, they abandoned this practice) and there was a decline in the produce.â He (the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam) happened to pass by them and said: âWhat has gone wrong with your trees?â They said, âYou said so-and-so (and we acted upon your words).â Thereupon he, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âYou have better knowledge in the affairs of the world.â [Muslim]
The Hadeeth was reported with a slightly different wording which reads, ââ¦When the matter is related to worldly affairs, manage it in the way you find suitable; however, if it is related to your religion, abide by my commands.â [Ahmad and Ibn Maajah]
Another version reads, â...If it is related to your worldly affairs, you are more knowledgeable of your own affairs; if it is related to your religion, it should be referred to me.â [Ahmad]
This is why the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âWhatever I have told you that it was from Allaah (divine inspiration), it is beyond doubt.â [Al-Bazzaar and Ibn Hibbaan]
Al-Haythami   said, âThe Hadeeth was reported on the authority of Ahmad ibn Mansoor Ar-Ramaadi   who was a trustworthy narrator. His trustworthiness was spoken about by some Hadeeth critics in a way that does not undermine his reliability; the other narrators are among those accredited by Al-Bukhari or Muslim, or one of them.â [End of quote]
This does not mean that when the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, spoke of other than the divine revelation, he was speaking in vain, with idle talk, or out of his personal desire. It rather means that the Ijtihaad of the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, may or may not be approved by Allaah. This is why An-Nasafi   commented on the previously mentioned verse as follows, âIt means, âWhatever the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, conveyed to you of the Quran, he, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is not speaking out of his own inclination or personal opinion. It is a divine revelation sent down to him from Allaah. This verse is used as evidence to support the argument of those who reject the idea that the Prophets may practice Ijtihaad (and maintain, instead, that whatever is uttered by them is divine inspiration). This view is refutable; Allaah, The Exalted, allowed the Prophets to practice Ijtihaad. If their Ijtihaad was approved and endorsed by Allaah, it was considered just like divine inspiration and not a mere personal endeavor or view.â
There is a famous disagreement among scholars regarding the idea of Ijtihaad of the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, in matters untackled by the divine revelation. The majority of Muslim scholars hold that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is allowed to practice Ijtihaad in matters pertaining to legislation and religious matters. If the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, practiced Ijtihaad and was right, his Ijtihaad was approved by Allaah; otherwise, it would be proven wrong via divine inspiration. For instance, the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, practiced Ijtihaad regarding the prisoners of war in the Battle of Badr. He, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, accepted the ransom and set them free. He, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, also practiced Ijtihaad in giving the hypocrites the permission not to participate in Tabook Battle. Shaykh Zakariyya Al-Ansaari   wrote, âThe preponderant opinion is that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is allowed to practice Ijtihaad, and this actually occurred. Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means):
Â·   {It is not for a prophet to have captives [of war] until he inflicts a massacre [upon Allaah 's enemies] in the land. Some Muslims desire the commodities of this world, but Allaah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allaah is Exalted in Might and Wise.} [Quran 8:67] 
Â·   {May Allaah pardon you, [O Muhammad]; why did you give them permission [to remain behind]? [You should not have] until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew [who were] the liars.} [Quran 9:43]
Allaah, The Exalted, disapproved of such actions and blamed the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, for accepting the ransom for the prisoners of war in the Battle of Badr and for giving permission for those whose hypocrisy was evident as they remained behind and did not join him in the Battle of Tabook. Verily, divine reproof can never be for a matter decided by divine inspiration. Therefore, it is clear that those two incidents were based upon Ijtihaad made by the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam.
Allaah Knows best.

				The Hoor Al-'Ayn (damsels of Paradise), are they like the angels in that they cannot sin, or are they like humans? And if so, then how are they deserving to be in Paradise?			
","
All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger. 
First of all, our advice to you is to ask only about matters that benefit you in your religion and what requires action and to refrain from raising such odd and pointless questions. 
The Hoor Al-âEen are definitely not angels, nor are they humans. Rather, as the scholars said, ""They belong to a different species created by Allah, and they were not born ... They are not descendants of Aadam (Adam), may Allah exalt his mention; rather, they are from a different species..."" [Fat-h Al-Bayaan: excerpted with slight modification] 
The Hoor Al-âEen are a special species that Allah created to honor the people of Paradise and to derive pleasure from them. So there is no room for asking whether they sin or not! Paradise is not an abode of religious assignment. There is also no room for asking about their deserving to be in Paradise.

				Salaam Alaikum, I am mobile developer and I am thinking of developing Islamic App, but I want to make sure that there is no problem in doing this kind of programs. The main idea of the app is to calculate the daily score for the good things people do every day for example: Praying Fard prayer = 100 point Praying Sunna prayer = 50 point Reading 1 page of Quran = 90 point Giving 1 dollar to poor people as Sadaqa = 75 point and so on.... So if the person for example pray 5 prayers and read 2 pages of Quran, his daily score will be: 5*100 + 2*90 = 680 The user also can share his score with friends to make it more competitive and motivate the friends to do more good things the next day :) is this idea conflicts with the basics of our religion? THanks

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and messenger.
In principle, there is nothing wrong with setting up an electronic application if it would motivate people to perform acts of obedience or remind them about them, such as programs which remind people about the time of the prayer, fasting, and so on. This is a form of cooperating in righteousness and piety. However, the program must be regulated by the Sharee'ah and free from innovations. 
As regards your statement, âto calculate the daily score for the good things people do every dayâ; if you mean good deeds or rewards, then we are not aware that there is any Sharee'ah text that determines the reward for performing an obligatory act of worship by a certain number of good deeds, like 100 good deeds or degrees. So, we cannot say such a thing without a Sharee'ah text, and we have not found text in relation to this.
Since there is no Sharee'ah-text to this effect, then it is not permissible to assign a certain number of good deeds or rewards which is not determined by Sharee'ah to an obligatory act of worship. Allaah says (what means): {...Do you say about Allaah that which you do not know?} [Quran 10:68] Allaah also says (what means): {And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.} [Quran 17:36]
On the other hand, if you do not mean to count good deeds or rewards but just the acts (of worship) and show their abundance or scarcity, then this is considered as counting good deeds which is not mentioned by any fixed number in the Sharee'ah, and we have not come across any statement of the scholars in this particular issue, but we believe that there is nothing wrong with doing it. It was reported that some of the Companions and the righteous predecessors used to count some good deeds like Tasbeeh (saying Subhaanallaah, i.e. glory to Allaah). Ibn Rajab said in Jaamiâ Al-âUloom wal-Hikam ""Abu Hurayrah had a piece of thread with 1,000 knots and he would not go to sleep until he had said Subhaanallaah (Glory to Allaah) according to the number of all these knots. Also, Khaalid ibn Maâdaan used to say Subhaanallaah 40,000 times in addition to what he would recite from the Quran. When he died, he was put on his bed to be washed, and he started pointing with his finger moving it and saying the Tasbeeh. âUmayr ibn Haani' was asked: âYou do not stop mentioning Allaah, how many times do you say the Tasbeeh per day?â He replied: â100,000 Tasbeeh, unless I make a mistake with my fingers""; meaning that he was counting with his fingers.â
On the contrary, Ibn Masâood   was reported to have said to people who were counting Tasbeeh, Tahleel (saying Laa Ilaaha Illa Allaah, there is none worthy of worship except Allaah), and the Takbeer (saying Allaahu Akbar â 'Allaah is the Greatest'): âCount your sins, I guarantee that nothing is lost from your good deeds.â This was reported by Ad-Daarimi with an authentic chain of narrators.
It might be understood that he disapproved of them doing so because they believed that it was obligatory for them to count.
It could also be understood that the Companions and the Taabiâis (the generation who followed them), who were reported to count, did so in order to motivate themselves.
Finally, we do not recommend making this counter in the program to be seen by other viewers as it may be a way of showing off, as the devil may incite someone to achieve more points so that they can be seen by others. Indeed, sincerity is a very serious and critical matter and being keen on hiding good deeds is more appropriate than showing them unless there is a benefit. The more possible it is to hide deeds and not let others find about them, the better, as this is more sincere and removed from showing off.
Allaah Knows best.

Under such a Mudaraba structure, the fund provider (Shariâa term âRab Al Malâ) and the Fund Manager (Shariâa term âMudarebâ) join hands whereby the Rab Al Mal provides funds to the Mudareb for investment in identified transactions/projects in a Shariâa-compliant manner and both share the profits emanating from such transactions/projects in a pre-agreed distribution ratio. Upon completion of the Mudaraba agreement, the Mudareb returns the capital to the Rab Al Mal along with the Rab Al Malâs share of profit earned by the Mudaraba by investing the capital. The profit distributed between the Rab Al Mal and the Mudareb must be the actual profit earned by the Mudaraba from the Shariâa-compliant transactions/projects.

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger. 
The Sunnah of the Prophet, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is to let one's forehead and nose rest on the ground while prostrating in the prayer. It was narrated on the authority of Abu Humayd As-Saaâidi, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said, âWhen the Prophet, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, prostrated, he would place his nose and forehead on the ground, and he held his forearms away from his sides and placed his hands parallel to his shoulders.â [Abu Daawood and At-Tirmithi] 
However, such placing of the forehead and nose on the ground should not be exaggerated. In fact, some scholars considered that such exaggeration is the act of the ignorant. The Maaliki book Sharh Kifaayat At-Taalib reads, âIt is sufficient for the praying person to place a part of his forehead on the ground without pressing it hard to the ground to an extent that it affects his forehead. This is disliked, and it is what the ignorant men and the weak women do.â
Ibn âArafah said, â(Imam) Malik held that it is disliked to press his forehead against the ground.â [Al-Mukhtasar Al-Fiqhi]
Sharh Az-Zarqaani âala Mukhtasar Khaleel reads, âHe should not press it, and Saâd ibn Abi Waqqas said that it is disliked and that only ignorant men and feeble women do this.â
So we advise you to stop exaggerating in the prostration, and it is enough that you place your forehead and nose on the ground without pressing them. This is a simple matter that does not need to be explained. If you asked a child to place his forehead on the ground without pressing it hard, he would easily understand what you mean without asking how to do it.
Allah knows best.

On the same day, his monthly salary was withdrawn by an unknown person, which means that he lost his salary and identity documents. Out of sympathy, a group of the company's employees tried to collect a sum of money from other employees to support him. My question is: Is it permissible to contribute to this with the intention of paying zakat-ul-Fitr?

This Hadeeth was narrated by Imaam Ahmad   on the authority of ʻAbdullaah ibn Masʻood  â not Ibn ʻUmar   as the questioner stated.
ʻAbdullaah ibn Masʻood   said, âA Jewish man passed by the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu ʻalayhi wa sallam, while he was talking to some of his Companions. Some people from Quraysh said to the Jewish man: âO Jew! This man claims that he is a Prophet.â Thereupon, the Jewish man said: âI shall ask him about something that only a Prophet would know.â He, then, came towards the Prophet, sallallaahu ʻalayhi wa sallam, sat down and said: ""O Muhammad! From what is Man created?â The Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu ʻalayhi wa sallam, answered: âO Jew! Man is created from the union of both the sperm-drop of the man and the sperm-drop of the woman. As for the sperm-drop of man, it is thick and from it bones and nerves are created, and the woman's sperm-drop, it is thin and from it flesh and blood are created.â The Jewish man then stood up and said: âThis is what those before you (i.e. the Prophets) used to say.ââ 
This Hadeeth was cited by At-Tabaraani in Al-Muʻjam Al-Kabeer. Ahmad Shaakir and Al-Albaani declared the Isnaad as Dha'eef (weak). Al-Arnaaâoot and the co-authors who verified and revised the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad classified it as weak as well and cited the statement of As-Sindi: â""And the woman's sperm-drop, it is thin and from it flesh and blood are created"" I say: The apparent indication of the Quranic verse: {Then, We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation...} [Quran 23:14] indicates that the fetusâ bones are formed from the combination of the manâs sperm-drop and the womanâs, and Allaah knows best. The chain of narration of this Hadeeth includes ʻAtaaâ ibn As-Saaâib who is labeled as Mukhtalit (confused in his narration due to old age or illness).â 
There is no room here for citing all the statements of scholars on that Hadeeth. However, the questioner may refer to Silsilat Al-Ahaadeeth Adh-Dhaʻeefah by Al-Albaani ; he commented on that Hadeeth in detail under no. 5457.

First of all, you should know that educating one's children is one of the most important and delicate matters. So, the parents and those involved in education should conduct it with patience, good insight, wisdom, and tolerance, and it shoud be done in a gentle manner.
âAa'ishah   narrated that the Prophet   said: ""Whenever tolerance is added to something it beautifies it, and whenever it is withdrawn from something, it leaves it defective.""[Muslim[
Using advice and guidance often gets better results than using other methods.
As regards physical punishment, it is not absolutely prohibited nor is it absolutely permissible.
In fact, the educator might, at some point, need to use physical punishment when other methods are fruitless.
However, there are some Islamic conditions that should be met in beating (physical punishment), among which is that it should be intended to educate and not to avenge, and it should not be abusive or causing the breaking of a bone.
Beating children was mentioned in a Hadeeth. 'Abdullaah Ibn 'Umar   narrated that the Prophet   said: ""Order your children to pray at the age of seven and beat them (if they neglect it) at the age of ten."" [Abu Daawood]

The three words have different meanings depending on their context in speech. They may be said and mean swearing by Allaah, because the Arabic letters Waaw, Baaâa, Taaâa are used for swearing, so if a person says Wallaahi, Billaahi, or Tallaahi, it means that he swears by Allaah or makes an oath by Allaah. 
On the other hand, if the word âAllaahâ is preceded by the letter Waaw or Baaâa, then it could mean other than swearing. For example, if someone says âIstaâantu Billaahâ, i.e. I seek help from Allaah, then the letter Baaâa here is for seeking help. 
Likewise, the letter Waaw could mean Istâinaaf (i.e. to indicate beginning a new sentence to make a different point); like the saying of Allaah ""Wallaahu Rauâoofun Bil Ibaad"" (which means): {And Allaah is Kind to [His] servants.}[Quran 2:207] 
As regards the letter Taaâa, if it is added to the word ""Allaah"", it only means swearing by Allaah.

				Is it necessary/obligatory to drink the Zam Zam water in standing position? What should we say when meet the man/woman at first time after he/she returned performing Haj/Umra?			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
It is not obligatory to drink Zamzam water in a standing position. The fact that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, drank Zamzam water while he was standing was to indicate that it is permissible to do so if needed and not that it is obligatory. It has been narrated on the authority of Ash-Shaâbi that Ibn âAbbaas   reported that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, drank (water) from Zamzam from a bucket while he was standing. [Muslim] 
In another narration, Ibn âAbbaas said, ""The Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, drank while standing from Zamzam."" [Al-Bukhari]
Meanwhile, drinking while standing was forbidden in the Hadeeth reported by Abu Saâeed Al-Khudri   that the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, forbade drinking while standing. [Muslim] Imaam An-Nawawi commented on this Hadeeth, saying: ""The forbiddance (mentioned in the Hadeeth) is to be understood as reprehensibleness (not prohibited). And the fact that he, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, drank while standing indicates that it is permissible to do so. Hence, there is no contradiction in this regard."" [Explanation of Saheeh Muslim]
For more benefit, please refer to Fatwa 83276.
As far as we know, there is no reported statement or expression to be said to the person upon returning from Hajj or âUmrah; however, there is no harm in welcoming and congratulating him with a customary permissible expressions such as ""May Allaah accept your Hajj"" or ""Praise Allaah that you have returned safe and sound,"" or ""Praise Allaah for reuniting us,"" or similar expressions that indicate happiness with one's safe return.
Al-Qayloobi   said in his annotations to the commentary of (An-Nawawi's) Minhaaj (At-Taalibeen): ""It is recommended for the man to take his family with him to Hajj and to take gifts with him and to to bring gifts for them (his family) when he returns from any trip, even if it is a short one. It is also recommended for him to send a messenger informing his family that he is arriving soon. It is not recommended for him to drop by at night; he should first go to the nearest mosque and perform two Rakâahs as a Sunnah prayer upon arrival from travel. It is recommended to throw a banquet, known as Al-Naqeeâah, for the traveler when he returns home, and his family should be at his reception with others. When someone comes back from Hajj or âUmrah, it is recommended to congratulate him by saying, 'May Allaah accept your Hajj or âUmrah, forgive your sins, and compensate you for what you spent.' If the person returns from a military expedition, it may be said to him, 'Praise Allaah for blessing you with victory and honor.'""
As-Subki   said: ""The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, used to embrace one another when returning from travel. âAa'ishah   reported that Zayd ibn Haarithah arrived in Madeenah while the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, was in her house. Zayd knocked on the door and the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, rose to welcome him, trailing his garment. He embraced and kissed him."" [At-Tirmithi: Hasan (good)]

				What is the ruling on avoiding having a relationship with one's parents due to depression? Keep in mind that there are other siblings who take care of the parents.			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
It is not permissible for a child to abandon his parents and completely sever the ties with them because of depression or any other reason as long as he is an adult and has free will. Even if he has siblings who are taking care of his parents, it is not permitted for him to sever the ties with them, and he is still obliged to be kind and dutiful to them.
Nevertheless, being kind and dutiful to the parents is not limited to visiting and taking care of them; it is a broader concept. A child is permitted to travel far away from his parents for a benefit, but he can still be kind and dutiful to them by asking about them, writing to them, speaking to them on the telephone, and the like. For more benefit, please 125841 and 125504.
On the other hand, if a child abandons his parents without willing to do so but due to being overcome by his mental disorder, then he is not sinful for this.

				ÙA Muslim living in an un-Islamic country. Working in a government organization ordering business. On income the government deduct income tax which is 30% as per law of a particular country if gross income exceed in a year one lakh fifty thousand .That is he is paying a good portion of money to government and if saved some amount out of that paying Zakaat as well on the gross earning. What is the Islamic ruling in such a case i.e., how a Muslim will be spared from double payment. To advise that go and settle in an Islamic country is simple but practically difficult. Only little country is Islamic. Most countries are only Muslim countries and not Islamic countries where they follow man made law and income tax law also exist which is a sorry state of affairs.			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
 
If the tax that the questioner mentioned is agreed upon by the government and the person who lives on its land, and he himself agrees to it, or that he is obliged to pay tax in return of some services that are provided for him, then he has to abide by this agreement unless it is proven to him by certainty or he is pretty sure that the government is going to use it in forbidden matters.
In such a case, it is permissible for you to avoid paying tax in a way that you do not expose yourself to danger or to humiliation, as it is not permissible for a Muslim to humiliate himself in front of a non-Muslim.
As regards the tax that is imposed on a person without a prior agreement [between the two parties],  and there are no services that are offered for him in return, then he is not obliged to pay it and it is permissible for him to avoid paying it.
In any case, you should know, dear brother, that whether you paid these taxes or not, it is not permissible to count them as Zakat money, because Zakat should only be spent on eight types of people and it is not sufficient or acceptable to spend it otherwise.
It is known that tax is not spent in the same channels the Zakat is spent.

https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/335734/shaafiis-view-regarding-shaving-beard,"
				Assalaamu alaykum. I read somewhere that there is Ijmaaâ (consensus among the scholars) on the fist-length beard as being mandatory, and once there is Ijmaaâ, nothing can change it after that. However, in the Shaafi'i Fiqh, I read that the strong position regarding the beard is that it is disliked to shave it. So is the Shaafi'i Fiqh going against the Ijmaaâ? Is that permissible in Usool-al-Fiqh (principles of Islamic jurisprudence)?			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger. 
It is not problematic according to most scholars of Islam who consider the authoritativeness of Ijmaaâ that it is not permissible to go against it if it becomes evident to the scholar that Ijmaaâ is confirmed â as detailed in the chapters on Ijmaaâ in the books of Usool al-Fiqh (principles of jurisprudence). 
However, the mere narration of a given scholar about Ijmaaâ on a given issue does not necessarily mean that the Ijmaaâ is confirmed regarding that issue; rather, it is Ijmaaâ in the view of this scholar, and other scholars may consider that Ijmaaâ is not confirmed on that issue. Ijmaaâ is evidence, and the scholars may differ in opinion in regard to the Fiqh issues on which Ijmaaâ is reported, in the same manner that they may differ in opinion in regard to the evidence from the Quran, the Sunnah, Qiyaas (analogy), or the statements of the Companions. 
This is one of the explanations that clarifies the existence of many issues on which a scholar narrates Ijmaaâ while there are other scholars who hold a different opinion, especially if we know the difficulty of knowing the Ijmaaâ after the time of the Companions, because the scholars were scattered in different countries, and most of the Ijmaaâ that was narrated after the time of the Companions was in the sense that it is not known that there are other scholars who contradicted this view, and not meaning that it is authoritatively asserted that there is no one who contradicted this view. 
Regarding the issue that you asked about, then there is no Ijmaaâ. As you mentioned, the view of the Shaafi'i School is that it is only disliked to shave the beard and not forbidden. This means that there is no confirmed consensus for them about shaving the beard â let alone taking what is beyond a fistâs length, otherwise they would not have differed (with the consensus). 
Rather, one of the great former Imaams who knew the differences of opinions among the scholars and Ijmaaâ, Ibn Jareer At-Tabari â who died in 310 A.H. â narrated the difference of opinion in taking from the beard regardless of whether it is limited to the fistâs length or not. 
Fath Al-Baari, authored by Ibn Hajar   reads, âAt-Tabari narrated a difference of opinion about what is taken from the beard, whether or not there is a limit for it, so he reported from a group that the limit is to take what exceeds a fist. It was also narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that one takes from its length and width what is not considered aberrant. The same thing was related from âAtaaâ. These scholars interpreted the prohibition to mean prohibiting what the non-Arabs used to do in cutting the beard and lightening it.â
However, we do not know of any scholar who explicitly stated Ijmaaâ on the prohibition of taking from what is less than a fist. All what is available is what Ibn Humaam from the Hanafi school of jurisprudence mentioned in Fath Al-Qadeer, as he said, âAs regards taking from the beard if it is less than a fist as done by some Moroccans and the effeminate men, then no scholar has permitted this.â [Abridged] 
It is not correct to rely on such a statement in asserting that there is an established consensus on the issue; as the scholar who quoted this (Ibn Al-Humaam) is a relative late comer, from the ninth century, as he died in 861 A.H. No one had preceded him by relating a consensus as far as we know, even though the statement is probable in principle. It could be that what he had meant by âno scholar has permitted itâ is that no one permitted it in the Hanafi School. So just be mindful of this. 
Even if he had meant to actually relate a consensus on the issue, then the mere narration of an Ijmaaâ does not necessarily mean that the Ijmaaâ is confirmed about that issue â as we have already clarified, let alone if the difference of opinion is confirmed by someone who came before him by many centuries and who was much more knowledgeable than him about the statements of the scholars â such as Ibn Jareer . 
Since there are scholars who claim the existence of Ijmaaâ and denied the existence of difference of opinion, and on the other hand, there are those who prove the existence of the difference of opinion, the view of those who confirm the existence of difference of opinion comes in priority, because they have more information regarding the same issue. 
Ibn Taymiyyah   said, âWhoever knows the difference of opinion and confirms it, then he has knowledge and he has confirmation, so his view comes in priority over those who deny it who did not know of it, according to the agreement of the Muslims.â 
We conclude by stating that the preponderant opinion on the issue in our view at Islamweb is the opinion of the majority of the scholars, that it is forbidden to completely shave the beard, based on the general indication of the texts commanding to let the beard grow, and that trimming the beard by taking what exceeds the fist is lawful, but not to take from it what is less than a fist, based on the apparent statements of the Companions such as Ibn âUmar and Abu Hurayrah . For more benefit, please refer to fatwa 332320.

He didnt tell me that before marriage, the issue is that he has a sisiter and an older brother and hia older brother is well off and earns good momey but does not support the mom with anything because my husband want to do it all himself because he belives taking care of his mom is like sadaka . The main issue is that now i have to spend more than half or my salary which is more than what i was spending before marrying him so we can afford living bybrenting a new place and be able to save . Also being the only one who supports his mom , she always wants him around to take her places and drop her off to visit people and so on which most times does not leave us alone time as he is always around her for her needs( she is in perfect health) . She is not accepting the fact that her son is married and she thinks i took him away from her and at the same time he never says no to her which is really stressing me out. Before we got married he told me i will be moving with him in his apartment and his mom will move with his brother because he has a biger space or she will move to government housing but after we did Nikah he told she is not moving and i have to move and live with them because his mother changed her mind and doesnât want lo leave the apartment.But i refused because i want my privacy and the apartment is very small , he was very mad at first and she keep telling him that he works hard for this money and he shoulf not rent out a place with me even though ill be paying most of the rent. Also to let you know, she gets money allowance from government but my husband tells her to keep it for herself and not spend anything as he pays everything for her. Is what my husband doing is right? And how shouldi talk to him about this issue ?

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger. 
It is good that your husband is keen on being kind and dutiful to his mother and help her with some of his money, even if she does not need it, and to comfort her heart. 
This is kindness and dutifulness to the parents and this is a great matter, especially to the mother, as we have already highlighted in Fataawa 87019 and 84942, so please refer to them. We hope that, because of this dutifulness, blessing and goodness will prevail in your family. 
However, despite what we have mentioned about the excellence of kindness and dutifulness to the mother, it is not permissible for your husband to be unjust to you or wrong you because of being dutiful to his mother. 
He must fulfill the rights of his mother and fulfil your rights as well. Among your rights upon him is to spend on you in reasonable terms, namely to provide you with what suffices you of food, drink and clothing. He must also provide you with an independent accommodation, even if it is a rented one. You are not Islamically obliged to live with his mother or any of his relatives. Also, he does not have to obey his mother if she prevents him from providing you with this accommodation. Additionally, you do not have to spend from your own money on yourself or pay part of the rent, unless you do so with your own free will. 
For more benefit, please refer to Fataawa 253297, 297622, 260551, 340528, and 131695. 
Making you happy and allocating some time for you too to express sympathy and enjoy times of friendliness and to have pleasant moments with each other; this is part of the good marital relatioship towards you as the Prophet   used to do with his wives.
We advise you discuss this matter with your husband in a soft and gentle manner in light of what we have mentioned. However, you should choose the most appropriate time to speak with him about this. 
Supplicate Allah earnestly to guide him and make him regain his senses. It is also acceptable to seek the help of his relatives and friends to speak to him about this if necessary. However, it is better, whenever possible, to solve your problems with him without the intervention of any outside parties.

My question is: given that many kinds of Naat (form of poetry) and songs contain Shirk (polytheism) wordings, I came across a problem, like saying 'O Prophet' is wrong if it is used in this context. Now, only Allaah is Present at all times and you can only call Him, so does that also apply to all songs in which almost everybody is talking to their lover or partner, singing, while that person is not present? Does it fall in the category of Shirk? If yes, is it really so widespread in the Muslim world too?

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
We ask Allah to relieve you from this Waswaas (OCD) and completely heal you from it and bless you with tranquility and reassurance. 
We advise you to supplicate Allah as much as is possible, as He answers the supplication of the person in distress and He removes the harm; Allah says (what means): {Is He [not best] Who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember.} [Quran 27:62] 
You should be keen on performing Ruqyah (healing through Quranic recitation and supplication), as this is the cure, Allah willing. As regards music, it is an illness and not a cure. Allah did not put a cure for this nation in what He has forbidden for them; for more benefit, please refer to fatwa 120956. 
Regarding your question, calling a person can have several meanings, which are understood from the context, and it does not necessarily include supplicating and seeking the help of the creature. 
Perhaps what is meant by it is recalling the image of the person who is called to mind; this is what is predominant in regard to what you mentioned that is said in poetry (and song lyrics). 
Shaykh Ibn Taymiyyah   said in his book Iqtidhaaâ As-Siraat Al-Mustaqeem, âThe saying 'O Muhammad, O Prophet of Allah,' and the like, is a call by which one thinks in his heart about the one who is called, so he is addressed because he is witnessed in the heart, like the praying person saying (in the Tashahhud), 'Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.' A person does such a thing a lot to address the one whom he imagines in himself if there is no one outside who hears the speech.â

				It's clear that Islam gives rights to married women to own and manage their money ""as they like"" but does Islam put preference on how to spend this money? I and my kids are making a lot of investing to let my wife work, we have did the right to have this money back instead of spending it on my wife's parents or any other issues? Please advice us as I am close to taking a decision to divorce her because of this issue. I will then choose a not workingwomen who takes care of me and my child better.			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
A woman has the right to own and manage her property according to Islamic conditions just like a man. The Quran advised her like a man to be economical when spending without being extravagant or too stingy.   Allaah Says (what means): {And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful.} [Quran 17:26-27] Allaah also Says (what means): {And [they are] those who, when they spend, do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever, between that, [justly] moderate.} [Quran 25:67] 
In principle, a woman's work should be at her home, educating her children and taking care of her husband. If she needs to work outside her home, she should abide by the Islamic conditions, like wearing Hijab, not staying in seclusion with non-Mahram men, and not traveling alone without a Mahram. 
As regards the money you and your kids had given to your wife, then if you had given it to her to invest it and you had not given it to her as a gift, then you have the right to take your money back whenever you wish and spend it in whatever you want. 
However, if a woman has money, she should not be prevented from helping her parents or managing her wealth as she wishes unless she becomes extravagant in her spending, in which case, the Muslim judge decides whether or not she is legally incompetent to spend her own money. 
Having said that, we advise our dear brother not to hasten to divorce his wife as divorce is the most hateful but lawful act in the Sight of Allaah. You can manage to get this problem settled with your wife. We also advise your wife to concentrate on her household, on the education of her children and on taking care of her husband. This is indeed more appropriate to her nature and more preferable to her husband. 
Allaah Knows best.

				My question is about waswas regarding following a particular madhab. Me and my husband used to follow hanafi. But in case of a conditional divorce, my husband asked our local scholar and got fatwa that it did not count as he only intended threat. I also wrote about it to you. But my mind is at unrest because I already knew about the hanafi fatwa that such a divorce is counted. Still I did not ask any hanafi scholar (may be out of fear) but agreed when my husband wanted to ask local scholar. What if the view that one has to follow his own madhab in all situations is true? What will be my defence then? I get severe waswas and cannot serve my husband. I cannot concentrate in prayer, dhikr because my mind keeps telling me if its all zina then I am doomed. I continuously blame myself for my disobedience to husband that led him to say words of divorce. I think like if I had not done such and such.. But again I feel such thought is contrary to Qadr. Please do not redirect me to previous answers. Please make my mind rest about madhab issues.

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
The fact that you follow the view of the Hanafi Math-hab (School of jurisprudence) should not prevent you from acting according to another view of the scholars in this matter or any other matter.
A Muslim is required act according to what he is reassured to be in conformity with the truth, and he is not obliged to follow a specific Math-hab or ask a particular Shaykh in all matters for a Fatwa.
For more benefit, please refer to Fataawa 89353 and 234370.
Even if it is said that one should follow a specific Math-hab, a person who is affected with whispers is permitted to follow the easiest Math-hab as a way of repelling the difficulties or harm that are caused by Waswaas (whispers).
Therefore, we advise you to repel whispers and not pay any attention to them.

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger. 
Clothes are not defiled by coming in contact with any person's sweat, even if this person is a non-Muslim, because the perspiration of the human being is ritually pure. 
The Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Fiqh reads, ""The scholars held that the perspiration of human beings is absolutely pure, and there is no difference in this regard between the Muslim and the non-Muslim, the intoxicated (drunk) and the sober person, or the menstruating woman and the one in a state of Janaabah (major ritual impurity)..."" 
It was authentically narrated in Saheeh Al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim that the Prophet, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, performed ablution from a water container belonging to a polytheist woman. He tied up Thumaamah ibn Uthaal when he was a disbeliever to a pillar in the mosque. He ate from the goat gifted to him by a Jewish woman from Khaybar. He ate the cheese brought from the lands of the Christians, as narrated by Ahmad and Abu Daawood on the authority of Ibn âUmar, may Allah be pleased with him. He, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, also ate barley bread and rancid fat offered to him by a Jewish man. The verse in Soorah Al-Maa'idah, which was the last verse to be revealed in this regard, underlined that it is lawful for the Muslims to eat the food of the People of the Book and marry their (chaste) women. Moreover, the Prophet, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, served food to the delegation of the disbelievers without washing the vessels, nor did he give his orders to have them washed. It was not reported that our righteous predecessors used to avoid the moisture of the non-Muslims. Had they avoided it, it would have been widely reported.

It is not permitted for a non-Muslim to touch the Mus-haf (the Arabic text of the Quran) and he should not be allowed to do so even with the purpose of reading it in order to embrace Islam.  Al-Baaji   from the Maaliki school of jurisprudence, said: âIf a non-Muslim wants a Mus-haf to be sent to him so that he would ponder over its meanings, it should not be sent to him because he is impure and in a state of sexual defilement and it is not permissible for him to touch it and it is not permissible for anyone to give it to him.â
As regards the translation of the meanings of the Quran, it is permissible to give it to a non-Muslim because the ruling of the Quran does not apply to it; rather, it takes the ruling of the interpretation of the Quran.  Therefore, it is permissible for a non-Muslim and a person in a state of sexual defilement to touch it because it is not a Quran.  Furthermore, it is permissible for a Muslim to give it [the translation] to him [non-Muslim] especially if it is for the purpose of calling him to Islam.

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. We ask Allaah to exalt his mention as well as that of his family and all his companions.
 
Since these people gave you permission to bury your father in their land, they should not go back on their word as this part of the land had been allocated to the dead. However, if the dead is decomposed, they can in this case benefit from the land. Imaam Al-Shaafi'ee said: 'If a person gives permission to people to bury in his land, then wants to go back on his word, he can do so, as long as they did not bury in it, but he cannot take back the part of the land in which they had already buried a dead person.'
Ibn Qudaamah said: 'If the dead is decayed, then the owner of the land can take his land back.'
Therefore, the grave of your father does not eternally belong to him. And the owners of the land have no right to take it back before the corpse is decayed. Nevertheless, if the landowners want to benefit from the land before the corpse is decayed, and you are not able to prevent them, then you can move the remains of the dead. Whether the dead is decayed or not is a matter that can be determined by the people who are specialized in the field in your country, as this differs from one country to another. 
Finally, we remind you that it is disliked to write on one's grave. Al-Bukhari and An-Nasaa'ee   reported that Jaabir   said: ""The Prophet   forbade building over the grave, plastering it, extending it, or writing on it.""
An-Nawawi said: (Al-Shaafi'ee and the scholars of his school) said: 'It is disliked to plaster the grave, or to write on it the name of the dead, or the like, or to build on it', and there is no difference of opinion about this in our view. This is also the view of Imaam Maalik, Ahmad, and the majority of scholars. However, Abu Haneefah said: 'Our view is that it is not disliked.' We do not agree with this statement and our evidence is the previous Hadeeth.
But it is allowed according to the majority of the scholars to put a sign to mark the grave by using a stone or (a stick of) wood or the like, and it is desirable according to the Shaafi'ee school.

It is impermissible to lay carpets that are fully made of silk or of which silk comprises more than half of their fabric. This is forbidden in houses or elsewhere if they are to be used by men. This prohibition is based on the general indication of the Hadeeth in which the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: ""Silk and gold have been made unlawful for the males of my community and lawful for the females.""

				I am a doctor by profession. I want to know about Tayammum (alternate for Wudu) if a patient comes with fracture of bones in the hand he should keep his hand immobilized and should plaster hand for 2 months. So is it necessary for the patient to perform his prayers which he has performed when he was sick. He can't neither use water nor sand for his purification while he is sick.  Does that patient need to perform his prayers again?  			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
 
Yes, it is permissible for a person whose hand is broken and plastered to wipe over the plaster when he wants to purify himself for the prayer as long as he needs the plaster, whether that purification is from minor impurity or major impurity.
It is reported in a Hadeeth that the Prophet   said about a man who suffered a severe head injury: ""He has to wipe over his head and wash all his body."" [Abu Daawood]
Therefore, a person who had prayed in this condition does not have to repeat the prayers that he had performed while wiping over the plaster. However, if a person has plaster on any part of his body and performed prayers without wiping over the plaster when making Ghusl (i.e. ritual bath), ablution or Tayammum (dry ablution) [if he is allowed to perform the latter], then his prayer is invalid. The Prophet   said: ""The prayer is not accepted without purification."" [Muslim]
Therefore, in such a case, such a person has to make up for the prayers that he had performed in that condition while he was able to use water or soil.
However, if he was unable to use water or soil neither directly or for wiping, and neither by himself nor with the help of somebody else, then the ruling that applies to him is that he cannot perform ablution or Tayammum (dry ablution), and so, he should pray as he is.
Nonetheless, the scholars differed about this issue.

Allah says (what means): {He would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected.} [Quran 37:144] 
Many interpreters of the Quran mentioned that the meaning of the verse is: âThe belly of the whale will be his grave until the Day of Resurrection.â 
They attributed this interpretation to Qataadah. 
It appears that what is meant by {the Day they are resurrected} is the day when the creation will be resurrected; as Allah says about the supplication of Iblees (Satan): {He said: My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.} [Quran 38:79] 
Tafseer At-Tabari reads (12/332), âAbu Jaâfar said, âThe interpretation is that Iblees said to his Lord, 'Give me a delay and postponement, and extend my life-span and do not make me die ... until the day the creation will be resurrected.'ââ

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
 
Jaabir ibn âAbdullaah   narrated that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: ""When night falls (or when it is evening), stop your children from going out, for the devils spread about at that time. When part of the night has passed, release them and close the doors and mention Allaah's Name, for the devil does not open a closed door. And tie the mouths of your water-skins and mention Allaah's Name; cover your containers and utensils and mention Allaah's Name. Cover them even by placing something across them, and put out your lamps."" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim] 
Ibn âAbdul-Barr   said: ""This is a prophetic tradition enjoined to keep people safe from the devils among mankind and jinn. The Prophet's words 'the devil does not open something closed, and does not untie a water skin,' consists in his informing about Allaah's favor to His human slaves in that the devil was not given the power to open doors, untie water skins or uncover utensils, and that the devil was deprived of this ability, even though he was given the ability to do what is worse than this, like entering places humans cannot enter."" [End of quote â excerpted from the book entitled Al-Istithkaar]
Windows are apparently analogous to doors regarding the command to close them. The reason for this is to protect people and property against transgressors and to prevent the entry of the devils. This is what Ibn Daqeeq Al-âEed referred to when he said: ""The command to close doors entails the religious and worldly benefits of guarding the lives and money of people from transgression and mischief, especially from the devils."" [End of quote]
Nonetheless, the command here has the effect of recommendation and advice (not obligation) as some scholars have said. Ibn Hajar quoted Al-Qurtubi as saying: ""All the commands mentioned on the matter are a matter of advice for the general good and it is possible that they are for religious desirability, especially in relation to one who does that with the intent of obeying the command."" [End of quote]
Moreover, a Fatwa of the Standing Committee reads: ""The authentic Hadeeth reported in Al-Bukhari, 'When night falls (or when it is evening), stop your children from going out' and which continues, 'and put out your lamps' â is this a command (an obligation)? If it is desirable, then what indicates that it has the effect of desirability instead of obligation? 
Answer: These commands mentioned in the Hadeeth are understood as recommendations and advice according to the majority of the scholars, as a group of scholars have stated, among them Ibn Muflih in his book Al-Furooâ (1/132) and Ibn Hajar in his book Fat-h Al-Baari (11/87).

				After 19 years of marriage with 4 children currently me and my wife live close but we are seperated. Unfortunately before I realised I was in need of medical help, I issued my wife with Talaqs. With words similiar to ""From me you have Talaq"", on more then two occasions. Mentally I was in a disoriented state, the night before I issued one of the talaqs, I was considering crashing my car into a lamp post. When I issued the talaq I threw a table in front of me to the floor. This was really out of character for me as I am a happy and calm person normally. On two occassions since I read the isitkhara dua, on the night at about 1am on one occassion, I saw my son asking me to come home. On the second time near the morning I saw my wife. After this I sought medical help, evenually I was diagnosed with Post Polio Syndrome (PPS) by a specialist Doctor, this basically means in a day I run out of energy quickly and need to pace myself. I am not sure if this is related to PPS but most days I find it difficult to sleep completely through the night. If I do not get enough sleep I become more emotional in a day, my mental well being gets affected. Over the last 4 years I have had times when I cry uncontrollably on my own, I loose my temper quickly in family situations. Which is really out of character for me. I am on depression tablets as the Doctor feels chemicals in my brain might have got effected. I got polio at eight months old this left me with permanent walking problems, PPS strikes a lot later in life in my case more then 30 years older. I didn't know I was really unwell with depression, sleeping problems and Post Polio Syndrome symptoms including fatigue and also I believe I had OCD (Obsessive compulsive disorder) repetitive thoughts that caused me anguish and all of these things made me disoriented. Can me and my wife continue with married life so our children can have a proper family? With normal health I would not have issued the talaqs.

			Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions. According to the consensus of Muslim scholars doubt alone does not have any weight concerning divorce of one's wife.  The Muslim jurists divide doubt in three categories:1. The doubt which is considered null, (having no weight, as though they don't exist) according to the agreement of jurists.  2. The doubt which may have some weight or importance and regarded as legal according to the consensus of Muslim jurists.3. Those doubts, which Muslim scholars differed concerning their rule, whether they may be acceptable or not, i.e., to be acted upon or not.An example of the first kind of doubt is if a person doubts whether he divorced or not.  This doubt is null (has no weight) according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars, because the compulsory condition for a valid divorce is one should pronounce the word of Talaq, or the words which indicate Talaq, intentionally and freely.Allah knows best.

For example, I am supplicating Allaah to tell me what to do with a conflict that I am facing (I am not making Istikhaarah [prayer of consultation]). After supplicating, something in my mind tells me what to do on how to solve this conflict that I am facing. Does this means that Allaah gives me the idea to solve the conflict? I am asking this question because I already dealt with problems in my life and every time I communicated with Allaah by supplicating to Him and asking Him for His help, I got an idea on what to do each time I finished supplicating Him. I told a Muslim about this, and that Muslim did not understand me.2) When a person is making Istikhaarah, how would a person know if what they ask for is working out? Will there be signs that will appear to that person that will inform them that they will get what they ask for or not?Allaah willing you understand my two questions.

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad, sallallaahu ʻalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger. 
When you turn to Allaah in supplication and seek His help imploring Him to bless you with what is good for you and to safeguard you from harms, it is likely that He inspires you with a way out of your problem as you implore Him and turn to Him for guidance and aid. This calls for striving in expressing gratitude to Him and praising Him as befits Him. This is not a strange thing in the slightest; Allaah, The Exalted, answers the supplication of those in need who call upon Him and relieves the distress and harms. Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means): {Is He (not best) Who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil?} [Quran 27:62] He also says (what means): {And when My servants ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.} [Quran 2:186]
What you mentioned is a manifestation of the kindness and mercy of Allaah and there is no difficulty in explaining that to others. Verily, the kindness and mercy of Allaah have no limits.
As for the Istikhaarah prayer, we believe that when the person performs the Istikhaarah prayer, he should go ahead and do what he is doing Istikhaarah about, and if he finds that the matter is facilitated, then this is a sign that this is good for him; otherwise, he should give it up and know that it is not good for him and be content with the choice of Allaah for him, knowing that it is definitely better for him than his own choice for himself.

https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/45462/no-contradiction-between-the-ahaadeeth-of-fasting-aashooraa,"
				There are some Hadeeths narrated that mention the reasons for fasting on âAashooraaâ and they are apparently contradictory. Some narrations, for instance, signify that Muslims observed fasting on this day in Makkah before Hijrah and that the Quraysh used to also fast on it. They also used to garment the Kaâbah on this day, as narrated by Al-Bukhaari and others. There are other Hadeeths which signify that fasting on this day was ordained after Hijrah when the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, found the Jews venerating this day on which Allaah saved Moosa (Moses), may Allaah exalt his mention, from Pharaoh. How can we reconcile between the versions?			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His Slave and Messenger. 
 
It was narrated on the authority of Ibn âAbbaas  âThe Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, arrived in Madeenah and saw the Jews fasting on the day of âAashooraaâ (10th of Muharram). He, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, asked them about this. They replied, âThis is a good day; the day on which Allaah rescued the children of Israel from their enemy. So, Moosa fasted this day.â The Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âI have more claim over Moosa than you.â So, the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, fasted on that day and ordered (the Muslims) to fast on it too.â [Al-Bukhari and Muslim] 
It was narrated on the authority of âAaâishah   that she said, ""Quraysh would fast on the day of âAashooraaâ in the pre-Islamic period, and the Messenger of Allaah, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, too, would fast on that day. When he migrated to Madeenah, he, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, fasted on that day and ordered Muslims to fast on it too."" [Al-Bukhari and Muslim] 
There is no contradiction between this Hadeeth and the previous one, and the reason is that the Jews' saying did not create a new ruling, but it was rather simply just a description of the state of affairs and an answer to a question. 
Ibn Hajar   said,
The Hadeeth does not contradict the Hadeeth of âAaâishah since it is possible that both the Jews and the Quraysh used to fast on it at the same time for different reasons. Al-Qurtubi   said, ""Perhaps Quraysh fasted on this day based on following a previous divine law, such as that which was revealed to Ibraaheem (Abraham) . The fasting of the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, might have been by virtue of him agreeing with them as happened in Hajj, or because Allaah The Almighty permitted him to fast on it as a good deed. Later, when he migrated, he found the Jews fasting on it and asked them why they were fasting on it. So, the fact that he fasted on it and ordered Muslims to fast on it too might have been done in order to attract the hearts of the Jews just as he did by facing their Qiblah during prayer in the beginning. In any case, the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, did not fast on âAashooraaâ to imitate them; rather, he used to fast on it before knowing that they did so.

It should be noted here that, while it is not permissible to say Abu Jahl ââ, it is permissible to ask Allaah The Almighty to guide a non-Muslim, if he is still alive, as the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âO Allaah, guide my people as they do not know.â [Ibn Mardawayh] Moreover, it is confirmed that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, said: âO Allaah guide the tribe of Daws and bring them to me (as believers).â [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/359455/suspects-water-on-bathroom-floor-is-impure,"
				Assalaamu alaykum. There is a place near the toilet bowl in my washroom where the water never dries. A few days after moving in, I noticed a bluish colour in the water and thought that the toilet might be leaking as the soap in the water makes the water in the toilet bowl blue. Later on, I realized that some of the stains might have been dust, which clumps together, and since I cannot remember whether I was wearing my glasses or not, I cannot tell if the water was really blue or just had greyish dust clumps. After calling the maintenance technician, he told me that the water sits there because the tile in that area is slightly depressed, but he seemed not quite sure and offered to rework the bathroom. I feel scared that the water is impure and that my prayers might not be accepted because of it. Should I have them change the tiles just to make sure there are no impurities and the toilet is not leaking?Secondly, when I was far from Islam, I used to think of things like whether the false pagan deities of Ancient Greece were actually jinns that the people worshipped and if the war in their stories of Titans and the deities was a warped version of the war between angels and jinns. Do these thoughts constitute apostasy?Thank you.

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger. 
As for your first question, you do not have to change the bathroom tiles, and in principle, this water is pure, unless you are certain that it is impure to such an extent that you can swear that it is impure. Your previous prayers are valid in any case. 
As for your second question, you did not do something that constitutes apostasy, though those beliefs were false. 
Finally, we draw your attention to the fact that Waswaas (devilish whisperings/obsessive doubts) are a great evil, so you have to deal with them and get rid of them, because getting carried away with them leads you to a great evil.

			Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions.What the husband has said is not considered a divorce.

The couple should try their best to solve their problems between them. He should not tell others that he intends to divorce her, this practice can make the problem complicated and have very bad psychological effects on the wife. Therefore, the others may find a chance to interfere in the private matters of a couple.  Allah knows best.

				Assalamu'alaikum,Dear Sheikh, would you please mention the virtue of giving sahoor. I heard a hadith mentioning the virtue of giving Iftar, but rarely I heard the virtue of giving sahoor. Jazaakumullah khair			
","
All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger. {C}
There is no doubt that offering Suhoor (pre-dawn meal) to fasting people is something for which a person will be rewarded, but we are not aware of any religious text from the Quran or the Sunnah concerning the virtue of providing Suhoor for fasting people. 
However, there is general evidence that indicates the virtue of feeding people, such as the Hadeeth: ""The best of you is the one who feeds people."" [Al-Haakim and classified it as Saheeh; Ath-Thahabi agreed with him] 
Another Hadeeth reads: ""Indeed, in Paradise there are rooms whose outside can be seen from their inside, and their inside can be seen from their outside."" A Bedouin stood up and said: âWho are they for, O Messenger of Allah?â He   said: 'For those who speak kind words, feed others, fast regularly, and perform prayer during the night while people are asleep.'"" [At-Tirmithi and Ahmad] 
Moreover, 'Abdullaah ibn 'Amr   narrated that a man asked the Prophet : ""What Islamic traits are the best?"" The Prophet   said: ""To feed people, and greet those whom you know and those whom you do not know."" [Al-Bukhaari and Muslim] 
These Ahadeeth and others are about the virtue of feeding people and it includes providing Suhoor (pre-dawn meal) for the fasting people.

If that girl is religious as you mentioned, then you should be keen on marrying her and do not obey your parents in their forbidding you from marrying her as long as they prevent you based on such corrupt beliefs. You should try to convince them that the Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, guided us to marry the religious woman. Please refer to Fataawa 86667 and 84459.
As regards believing that her tribe brings about poverty and the like, this is a reprehensible superstition which belongs to the Jaahiliyah (pre-Islamic era of ignorance), and it is not permissible for a Muslim to believe in this or act in accordance with it. Hence, you should clarify the meaning of this to your parents and you should not desist from marrying that girl as long as she is religious as you mentioned.

","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
A person who assumes the state of Ihraam for Hajj or Umrah is not required to do anything due to just having an erection or a wet dream. In the case where he ejaculates while awake due to rubbing (i.e. his private parts being rubbed with his Ihraam clothes) and the like, his state of Ihraam is not invalidated. However, if he does this deliberately, he will be considered as having masturbated, in which case, the difference of opinion among the jurists   in regard to a person who masturbates while in a state of Ihraam would apply to him.
Al-Nawawi   said in Al-Majmooâ: âIf one masturbates with his hand and the like and ejaculates, then he is disobedient without any difference of opinion among the scholars. As regards whether or not the ransom is obligatory, then there are two opinions about this, the most correct of which is that the ransom is obligatory, and the second opinion is that no ransom is due, because he ejaculated without any Mubaasharah (contacting a woman skin to skin), so it is like ejaculating due to looking (at the opposite sex), so no ransom is due. If we adopt the view that the ransom is obligatory, then the ransom is the same like that of shaving oneâs head (i.e. fasting three days or feeding six poor persons or slaughtering a sheep as sacrifice) as we had previously mentioned in regard to engaging in Mubaasharah with oneâs wife without sexual intercourse, but his Hajj does not become void by masturbating without any difference of opinion among the scholars (in our School of jurisprudence).â
Also, Ar-Rawdh Al-Murabiâ, which is one of the Hanbali books, reads: âHe is obliged to slaughter a camel as ransom if he ejaculated due to Mubaasharah, or because of a kiss, or due to repeatedly looking (at the opposite sex), or ejaculated due to masturbation, by analogy to the ransom for having sexual intercourse with oneâs wife (while in Ihraam), and if he did not ejaculate, then he should slaughter a sheep as the ransom for removing the harm (in oneâs head like him having an ailment in his scalp necessitating shaving)â¦â
The Fiqh Encyclopedia reads while clarifying the views of the scholars regarding this issue: âHajj is not invalidated due to masturbating with oneâs hand according to the Hanafi, Shaafi'i and Hanbali Schools of jurisprudence, but in this case a ransom of a sacrificial animal is obligatory, as this is like Mubaasharah without sexual intercourse in regard to the prohibition and Taâzeer (discretionary punishment), so it is like it in penalty. However, according to the Maaliki School, Hajj becomes void by this, and they are of the view that it is an obligation to make it (the Hajj) up and offer a sacrificial animal, even if he did so out of forgetfulness; as he ejaculated due to committing what is forbiddenâ¦â
However, the preponderant view which we adopt here in Islamweb is the view of the majority of the scholars. For more benefit, please refer to Fatwa 164423.
On the other hand, if during Tawaaf (circumambulation around the Kaâbah), something that invalidates one's ablution occurs, then it is an obligation upon him to interrupt the Tawaaf and perform ablution again because being pure from any ritual impurity (either minor impurity which necessitates ablution or major impurity which necessitates Ghusl) is a condition for the validity of Tawaaaf, but this is not a condition for the validity of Saây (going between As-Safa and Al-Marwah); it is for this reason that it is permissible for a menstruating woman to perform Saây.
As regards your question âIs there a Shaytaan (a devil)â¦..â, then the answer is that the devil is keen on spoiling the act of worship of a Muslim whether it is Hajj, or âUmrah, or prayer or other acts, so a Muslim should seek the help of Allaah in performing his act of worship and avoid the whispers of the devil, and he should not open the door to whispers as they are from the devil. For more benefit, please refer to Fatwa 138425.

If free food, drink, or Iftaar (meal to break the fast with), are being distributed and I have the money to buy those things myself, is it wrong to take the free things if they are not specifically for poor people? And what about Iftaar? If someone is distributing Iftaar and I am not fasting, can I take and have that food, or should I leave it for a fasting person, or may I take it and give it to someone else who seems to be fasting? Here in Makkah, items, like mineral water bottles, are distributed for free around the Haram, and maybe inside also, and I am concerned with whether it is better to leave it or take it, like, for example, a water bottle, if I am not thirsty, can I take it? I rather buy water bottles from a shop to use them as containers for Zamzam water, as I am unable to decide. May Allah reward you, Shaykh.

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger. 
If the ones giving this food or water do not specify the poor in particular in giving it, then there is no harm on you in taking it and you bear no sin for it. Also, there is no harm on you in taking the water that is offered to you even if you are not thirsty. When you take the water, it becomes your property and you are entitled to give it to whomever you wish or keep it for some other time when you need it. The same goes for the food that is offered to the fasting people; if those giving it do not stipulate that it must be offered exclusively to the fasting people and may not be offered to anyone, then there is no harm on you in taking it. However, if the ones giving it specify the fasting people with it, then their wish must be honored and it is impermissible for you to take that food. If you take it, then you should give it to a fasting person who deserves it. The same applies to the food that is allocated to the poor; it is impermissible to take it if you are not considered poor.

			Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the World; and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions. Muslim scholars are of four opinions concerning the matter of dealing with a person whose money is mixed with Haram.1. Dealing with such person is forbidden.2. It is permissible.3. If the Haram dominates in his earnings then dealing with him is Haram otherwise it is dislikeable.  4. It is dislikeable only.Some contemporary scholars give preference to the rule that dealing with such person is dislikeable only.We conclude that as long as the majority of the income of this company is from Halal sources then your work there is not forbidden but it is not desirable. Therefore, we advise you to try to get rid of this job in the nearest future since one should take precautions not to deal with doubtful matters.  Nuaman Ibn Bashir said: ""I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart"".  Allah knows best.

It is not permissible for the wife to refuse her husbandâs call to bed (for sexual intercourse) unless she has a sound reason, like being in menses or being sick and so forth; for more benefit, please refer to Fatwa 88547. 
What you mentioned is not a sound reason for refusing to have sexual intercourse with your husband unless you know for sure or predominantly think that he may not perform the obligatory Ghusl (ritual bath) without any sound reason. It is better, in this case, to discuss the matter with him so that things will become clearer to you.

				Assalaamu alaykum. I am a publisher, and one of the books published by us is Science & Technology in the Golden Age of the Muslim World. It has been printed and sold to some booksellers now, but it includes one weak/unreliable hadith, which goes something like: ""The Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said to seek knowledge as far as China."" (There could be more weak narrations.) Now what shall I do? should I ask the booksellers to stop selling or to keep selling it? The intention is noble, as the book aims to revive the spirit of innovation, research, interrogation, and scientific advance, as was the case in the Islamic Golden Age. I have decided not to sell unless I get an approval. Our publishing house has lately published some books like the one mentioned above, but there are some shortcomings here and there.

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger. 
The hadeeth that you mentioned is false. Ibn Hibbaan said about it, âIt is false and there is no basis for it.â Besides, Ibn Al-Jawzi ruled that it is fabricated, and Al-Albaani supported their view in As-Silsilah Adh-Dhaâeefah. Please, refer to fatwa 92268.
As regards the existence of such a hadeeth in a book, then this does not necessitate forbidding printing the book and its publication.
Most of the books of heritage are hardly devoid of shortcomings like the mention of such invalid ahaadeeth. Nevertheless, these books continued to circulate among the scholars throughout the ages, and we have not heard of any scholar who forbade copying the books or printing them or selling them.
What is forbidden to sell and publish are the books of false sciences. 
An-Nawawi   said, âOur scholars said that it is not permissible to sell the books of Kufr (disbelief), as they do not have any permissible benefit; rather, they must be destroyed. The same applies to books on astrology, sorcery, philosophy, and other false and forbidden sciences; so selling them is invalid because there is no permissible benefit in them.â

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
 
The Prophet, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam  , said that every child is born with Fitrah (innate nature), and then his parents make him a Jew, Christian or a Magian. [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]
Fitrah means the innate inclination to Islam which is free from false beliefs and which only accepts true ones. If the self is left to its innate nature, it admits the Lordship of Allaah The Almighty, loves Him and worships Him without associating anything with Him. However, it is corrupted by the temptations of the devils whether from among humans or Jinn, including disbelieving parents. 
If a disbelieverâs son dies before puberty, the ruling on this person is explained in Fatwa No. 2740.  If the son reaches puberty but continues to be a Christian and dies in this state, he deserves Hell for his own actions, because he has reached the age of responsibility where he is held accountable for his deeds and choices. Allaah The Almighty Says (what means): {Every soul, for what it has earned, will be retained.} [Quran 74:38]
Allaah The Almighty is just and never oppresses anyone. He gave each person a mind, hearing and sight, and established convincing arguments and proofs through which a person can distinguish right and wrong. Allaah The Almighty Says (what means): {And have shown him the two ways.} [Quran 90:10] Thus a person will be rewarded in accordance with the choice he makes and the deeds he does.

Then, my teacher (who memorized the entire Qur'an) is very harsh, rude, inconsiderate and intolerant, and he does not allow us to pray Asr until the sun had already declined. He slaps the younger student when they make mistakes. (I find it very strange since he is supposed to be the most patient and kind in the community). I refuse to refer to him as a Hafiz ul-Qur'an. Please advise me on how to retain the Qur'an, and on how to help this brother.

The most important factor that helps a student in learning is having confidence in the teacher, liking him and being pleased with his behavior.  Good moral conduct and steadfastness on righteouness is what is required from learning the Quran. Therefore, if your teacher is as you described but you find good in him, then it is more appropriate to be patient with his misconduct and bear his mistakes. 
As regards how to rectify him, then you may seek the help of elder people who are close to him and who may influence him to exhort him. Also, we advise you to be good with him, behave properly with him and ask Allah to correct him. You may use any suitable means in this regard.

She pronounces the Shahadatain a lot, every time alone or if there is other people and she tries hard to learn the Qur'an in Finnish.My question is who does she need to officially become Muslim.

He no longer needs to register himself as a Muslim or take any certificate for that.However, if he cannot perform Hajj or Umrah or could be buried in a graveyard of non-Muslim due to what is written in official papers such as his passport, etc., then he should change his religion in those papers to the religion of Islam.

				As-salaamu 3laikum, I am living in a non-Muslim country and I want to know how we can know the authenticity of our teachers and books about Islam. There are no real scholars where we live and one or two of the people teaching us have been making doubtful statements. As there are many people in our community who want to learn about Islam, we often make use of the Internet and download books and so on. I am worried that there is no way to authenticate what we are learning from the Internet or to verify whether the people in our community that we think of as knowledgeable and trustworthy actually are. I have seen all of them making at least some errors. What should we do in this situation? I have been trying to verify information by checking it against a few different sources to see if they agree but I do not know if this is a valid methodology. Should we trust the books that are published in our country if we know nothing against them and lend them to each other, print out ahadith from websites like sunnah.com and show them to each other or do we have to give that up? Please note that we cannot fully trust the Islamic leaders in our country as they are very weak and are known for producing statements designed to reassure and please the non-Muslim majority in our country. In shaa Allah I will move to another area soon which may be better but I still don't know how to go about authenticating information about Islam. Please advise. Jazaakumu Allahu khairan

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
We ask Allaah to reward you generously for your keenness to seek beneficial knowledge and investigate the reliability of the sources and scholars from which you learn your religion; this is both commendable and desirable. 
Muhammad ibn Seereen   who was one of the great Taabiâis (successors of the Prophet's Companions) , said, âThis knowledge is religion; so, be careful about the person from whom you learn your religion.â 
Imaam Maalik   said, âThis knowledge is religion; so, scrutinize those from whom you learn your religion. I have met within these pillars - and he pointed to Al-Masjid An-Nabawi - seventy people who said, âThe Messenger of Allaah   said such and such..â and I did not take anything from them. Had any of them been entrusted with public treasury, they would have proved trustworthy, but they were not worthy to undertake this business (i.e. narrating Hadeeth). Then when Muhammad ibn Shihaab Az-Zuhri arrived, we crowded at his door though he was a young man...â. 
This indicates that one should learn knowledge from trustworthy scholars who are devoted to knowledge and do not only pretend to be. They should be pious and knowledgeable, from the followers of Sunnah, not followers of religious innovations as following the latter would bring about corruption of the heart and the poisoning of the mind. One of the righteous predecessors used to say, âIt is from the grace of Allaah that He blesses a young man with a mentor from the devoted adherents of the Sunnah.â
However, a scholar is not infallible. He may commit an error, and not every error entails having an aversion to him, and not all errors are the same in terms of gravity. The errors related to âAqeedah (creed) are not like those related to other subsidiary matters. 
We are not able to pass judgment about the scholars or the Islamic literature available in your country. However, if the scholars or entities distributing those books are trustworthy, then in principle, you may benefit from them. If you harbor doubts about any matter, you can consult other reliable entities to verify the doubted information.
There are many good websites you can benefit from in this regard, including our website and other websites such as Islamway (www.islamway.com) and Islam Question & Answer (www.islamqa.com). 
The website you referred to includes translations of much of the accepted Sunnah literature, such as Saheeh Muslim, Saheeh Al-Bukhari and the Hadeeth literature of Abu Daawood, An-Nasaa'i, At-Tirmithi, and Ibn Maajah   and the like. However, we can not determine whether the translation is good or not because this requires examination of all those books.

				Assalamu AlaikumDear Shiekh,My sister was having a pre-marital affair and was going out with the boy. She would listen to anyone and we didnât have control over her going out. The guy according our finding was very bad in all ways. As sister was extremely stubborn we gave her in marriage to same guy mid June 2018 to avoid any haram happening before marriage. I was the Wali as my father has passed away. She gave birth to a normal child early December 2018, meaning only five and half months after marriage. It is very likely this child is as a result of zina. I have not spoken to my sister or visited her since then. She calls me to inform the birth but I ignored her calls. Kindly advice Islamically what I should be doing.Salams

All perfect praise be to Allah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
Your sister establishing an affectionate relationship with that man before marriage is wrong and evil. Girls taking boyfriends (or boys taking girlfriends) is a matter of the Jaahiliyyah (Pre-Islamic Era of Ignorance) and Islam abolished it.
Allah Says (what means): {They should be] chaste, neither [of] those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take [secret] lovers.} [Quran 4:25] 
You should have prevented her from this evil as you are her guardian. Allah Says (what means): {Men are in charge of women.} [Quran 4:25]
Guardianship and being in charge mean protecting the worldly and religious interests. As-Sâadi   said:
""{Men are in charge of women} this means that men are in charge of women in terms of obliging them to fulfill the rights of Allah due on them by observing His obligations and preventing them from committing evils. Men are obliged to enforce this.â [End of quote]
Forbidding evil is obligatory according to oneâs ability. Abu Saâeed Al-Khudri   narrated that he heard the Prophet   say: âWhoever amongst you sees an evil, he should change it with his hand (i.e. physically); if he is unable, then he should change it with his tongue (i.e. verbally); and if he is unable, then he should change it with his heart (by detesting it in his heart), and that is the weakest level of faith.â [Muslim]. 
If a woman gives birth to a child in a period of less than six months of her marriage, then the child should not be traced to the fornicator (or adulterer), but it should be traced back to her, according to the view of the majority of the scholars, and this is the view that we adopt here in Islamweb.
Nonetheless, some jurists are of the view that if the fornicator accepts to trace the child back to him, then it is acceptable. 
Nevertheless, it is very important to mention here that the six months should be calculated according to the lunar months, and not the solar months. So, please be heedful of this. Therefore, if the child is born in six lunar months, then it is his son and is traced back to him.
If we presume that this child was the result of Zina (fornication or adultery), then if she repents and turns to Allah, you are not allowed to abandon her. As a matter of fact, even if she does not repent, it is permissible to keep ties with her, and it may be that keeping ties with her is better. Deserting a person or keeping ties with them depends on the benefit resulting from this, as stated by the scholars. 
For more benefit, please refer to Fataawa 378067, 378067, 97254, and 158403.

https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/90530/renting-contract-which-ends-by-owning-the-house,"
				I live in Canada, and there is a Muslim Housing program that is available to help Muslims purchase homes or businesses.  The way this works is based on partnership, where I put 30% of the price of the house I choose, then the corporation puts the remaining 70%.  The corporation ""rents"" its share over a period of time at a yearly rate of 7% of the price of the house.  My goal is to buy back their share with monthly or yearly installments (which is set at my convenience at the beginning of the contract).
I can do so in any way I want, and while doing so, my rent payments decrease because they are based on the corporation's share.  The sooner I buy back their share, the sooner I will own the house, all while paying taxes, insurance, and maintenance.
First of all, is this transaction Halaal?  Second, shouldn't the corporation share the taxes and other fees involved, they are a partner aren't they?  And last, they ask for a profit of 10% on the appreciation value of the house after the ownership is transferred to me, that is if I buy the house for $100,000 and after 15 years it is estimated at $110,000, we are asked to pay 10% of the $10,000 increase.  What does Sharee'ah say about this?  They say if we want them to share the yearly expenses with them, like taxes and insurance, they want 50% of the appreciation value.  I know it seems complicated, but it is not.  I just want an idea if this is ok or not, and what should be changed to make this Halaal?  May God accept you efforts and reward you according to your intentions.

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
The Muslim woman is obliged to cover her hair as long as it is attached to her head; Allah, the Exalted, says (what means): {O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves (part) of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.} [Quran 33:59] If her hair is detached from her head, she is not obliged to cover it. Accordingly, she bears no sin if a non-Mahram (marriageable) man happened to look at it. However, scholars held that it is recommended to cover the hair or other parts that are detached from the body, such as nail clippings, because these are parts of the body of the human being whom Allah has honored; Allah, the Exalted, says (what means): {And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with (definite) preference.} [Quran 17:70]
Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar   wrote, âOur scholars held that it is recommended to bury them because they are parts of the human being.â [Fat-h Al-Baari]
It should be noted that scholars held different views regarding the ruling on a non-Mahram man looking at the parts detached from a woman's body, including her fallen hair. some held that it is permissible, others held that it is impermissible, and others differentiate between what is detached during her lifetime and what is detached after her death.

If you really need this medicine, then there is no harm on you in taking it as long as it is not intoxicating (it does not make you drunk). We do not want to get into details regarding the juridical basis of this opinion, based on the assumption that the alcohol that intoxicates when consumed in a large amount is considered Khamr (prohibited alcoholic beverage) under the Shariah.
However, it is worth adding here that there is a strong scholarly view regarding the ruling on alcohol (used in medicine and the like); it holds that such alcohol is not classified as Khamr even if it intoxicates, because the definition of Khamr in the Shariah is the intoxicating beverage; i.e. what a person drinks and it makes him drunk as a result. However, alcohol (used in medicine and the like) is not a beverage. This view was adopted by the Egyptian Daar Al-Iftaaâ, which published a detailed fatwa to that effect on its website. Some researchers underlined that this opinion is in accord with the four mainstream schools of Fiqh followed by the Muslims.

","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger.
First of all, relieving oneself on the in-ground toilets does not necessarily cause the splashing of urine over the body, and it is permissible for you to ask your husband to change the in-ground toilet with a western toilet. Nevertheless, the solution may be achieved by using the in-ground toilet in a way that does not lead to the splashing of impurity over the body and also by not giving way to whispers. 
On the other hand, if a person is sure that his body is stained with impurity and this is not just whispers or doubt, then he has to wash the place of impurity. In case one does not know the exact place of impurity while being certain that he is stained with it, then he should wash all the part of the body that he doubts that it is stained with impurity.
In any case, we do not think that there is any hardship in doing this, praise be to Allaah. So, you should take it easy so that Allaah would make matters easy for you. For more benefit, please refer to Fatwa 95214.

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad   is His slave and Messenger. 
The person who said: âMay Allaah have mercy upon a person who knows his real statusâ, has really spoken eloquently. But it seems that you are ignorant of your status and you do no know that you are a weak human being: your beginning was a dirty sperm, your ending will be a dirty corpse, and you carry something dirty in your body [excrement]. 
This is your origin, your situation and your destiny. If you do not remember this, then we remind you of it now, so that you will put yourself in your real position and not dare to describe Allaah of injustice. 
What you said in your question can only come from one of two persons: either a crazy and insane person from whom the pen is lifted, and so he is not held accountable of what he says, and if this is the case, then this is the least serious of the two kinds of people. Or a person who neither believes in Allaah nor in the Last Day, so he needs to know Who Allaah is. 
The fact that people are equal, then this is true; they are of the same origin as far as their creation and humanity is concerned. However, they differ in their characteristics: some of them are kind and some are wicked, some are rich while some others are poor, some are ugly whereas some are handsome. The One Who favored some over others is the One Who created them, and since it was He Who created them, He is well aware of them, and he knows who deserves this particular favor and who does not deserve it. Allaah Says (what means): {Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?}[Quran 67:14] 
Therefore, every preference of Allaah for some of His creation is based on knowledge and wisdom; for more benefit, please refer to Fatwa 87624. 
You should know that by your statement you are repeating the statement of the infidels and the polytheists who were destroyed as related to us in the Quran. Allaah Says (what means): {And they said, âWhy was this Quran not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?â Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] that they may make use of one another for service. But the mercy of your Lord is better than whatever they accumulate.}[Quran 31-32] 
Ibn Katheer   said in his Tafseer (of the above verse): (i.e.: the matter is not in their hands; rather, the matter is in the Hands of Allaah, Who knows best where to put His Message. Allaah does not send down His message except on the people who have the purest heart and soul, and on the most honorable homes, and those who have the purest origin.) Besides, Shaykh Abu Bakr Al-Jazaa'iri said in his interpretation of the Quran entitled Aysar At-Tafaaseer: âAllaah denies this control and the corrupt proposal from them.... Since it is We Who divided amongst them their living sustenance, and We make so and so rich and so and so poor, and We make so and so a king and we prevent so and so (from having kingdom), then what about the prophecy which is most important than food and drink, so We are more deserving of it from them, so We reveal it to whomever We wish.â 
As in the verse in which Allaah Says (what means): {And when a sign comes to them, they say, âNever will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of Allaah. Allaah is most knowing of where [i.e. with whom] He places His message. There will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before Allaah and severe punishment for what they used to conspire.}[Quran 6:124] 
If the logic that you mentioned in your question is true, then this would imply that all the people would be Messengers and Prophets. If they were all as such, then to whom would they be sent? Would any sane person say this? 
Your statement in which you described Allaah to be unjust necessitates disbelief in Allaah and apostasy from the religion of Islam, so you should correct yourself and sincerely repent to Allaah. Apostasy means the loss of this worldly life as well as the Hereafter. Allaah Says (what means): {And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever -for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.}[Quran: 217] 
We have already warned you several times and we still urge you to occupy yourself with what benefits you in your worldly life and your religion. 
Allaah Knows best.

First of all, we ask Allaah to grant us and you wellness and safety from all evil, and to bless us all with guidance, piety, chastity and richness.
We have already issued Fatwa 86017, which clarifies that it is not permissible for the wife to masturbate, and that the absence of her husband does not justify that; so please refer to the above Fatwa. We advise you to supplicate Allaah as much as possible to make you chaste. You should occupy your time with what is beneficial. You should continue fasting, as it is by fasting that one achieves the piety that would deter him from committing what is forbidden. 
However, if you find a real need, like the fear of falling into fornication, or getting sick if you do not masturbate, then it would be permissible â in this case â to resort to it. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah   said: âMasturbating with oneâs hand is forbidden according to the majority of the scholars, and it is the more correct opinion of the two views of Imaam Ahmad; and the one who does it is to receive a discretionary punishment. According to the second view, it is disliked and not forbidden, but most of the scholars are of the view that it is not permissible, neither for fear of hardship nor for any other reason. Nonetheless, it was reported from a group of Companions and Taabiâis (followers of the Companions) that they permitted masturbation for a necessity such as if one fears of Zina (fornication or adultery) and cannot avoid it except by resorting to masturbation, or for fear that if he does not masturbate, he will become sick; this is the view of Imaam Ahmad and others. But if there is no necessity, then I do not know of any scholar who permitted it.â [End of quote] 
According to the view that masturbation is permissible for a necessity, we must differentiate between the one who does it for fear of what is forbidden and the one who does it for pleasure. We are concerned that a person might confuse these two matters and be accustomed to this forbidden act and do it for pleasure, and not restrict oneself to what removes the harm from him. The matter involves some prohibitions, so you should be careful. 
Finally, it should be noted that it is better for the husband to have his wife with him in his place of residence if possible, and it is not permissible for the husband to be absent from his wife for more than six months without her consent. Please refer to Fatwa 85711.
Allaah Knows best.

				What is the ruling on plucking the eyelashes? Sometimes they cause trouble when they get into the eyes and cause pain. This, however, is not done out of changing the creation of Allaah.			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
Plucking out or shaving the eyelashes is included in the prohibited Nams (prohibited removal of facial hair). In Muntaha Al-Iradat, it is stated: ""Nams is prohibited, it means plucking out the facial hair."" In Al-Muhalla, Ibn Hazm   said: ""Plucking the facial hair is prohibited. Thus, a woman who does so for herself or for others is cursed by Allaah Almighty."" 
However, if long eyelashes cause harm to the eyes, then it is permissible in such a case to trim a portion whereby the harm is removed.

				I went through some medical examinations and vowed to fast two consecutive days if the results would be good. Thanks to Allaah, the results were good, and I am now pregnant. Having suffered two miscarriages in the past, I am now afraid that the immediate fulfillment of my vow will cause harm to my pregnancy. Keeping in mind that I intended to fast even if I would do that two days after the day of the result, what should I do now? I take medicine twice a day. Am I permitted to delay the fulfillment of the vow until I get my pregnancy stable? Am I required to offer an expiation if I delay the fulfillment of the vow?			
","
All perfect praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad, sallallaahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
If the results of the medical examinations that you underwent prove that you are in good health, then you are required to fulfill the vow and fast two consecutive days. A conditional vow must be fulfilled once the condition is achieved. However, immediate fulfillment of a vow is not due unless it was specified with a certain time. If you specified a certain time for the vow, then you are required to fulfill it at the specified time. Your statement ""I intended to fast even if I would do that two days after the day of the result,"" does not signify specification; rather, it just indicates your intention to hasten to fast after that date. 
Consequently, it is permissible for you to delay the vowed fast due the fact that you take medicine, and you are required to fulfill the vow whenever you are able to do so. You are not required to do anything concerning delaying the fulfillment of the vow.  
Allaah Knows best.

All perfect praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad, sallallahu âalayhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
Scholars held different views regarding whether the Muslim who commits minor Shirk and dies without repenting might be forgiven if Allah wills it or if remains unforgiven, like major Shirk.
Shaykh Ibn âUthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him, was asked, âDo the words of Allah in the following verse include minor Shirk: {Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him...} [Quran 4:48]?â 
He replied:
âThe scholars held different opinions regarding this topic. Some of them said that it includes all kinds of Shirk, even minor Shirk, such as swearing by other than Allah; Allah will not forgive it. However, with regard to major sins, such as drinking alcohol and adultery, they are subject to the will of Allah; if Allah wills, He will forgive them, and if He wills, He will punish for them. Shaykhul-Islam (Ibn Taymiyyah) expressed different views in this regard. On one occasion, he said that Allah does not forgive Shirk even if it is minor, and on another occasion, he said that what Allah does not forgive is the major Shirk only. In any case, we must beware of Shirk altogether, because the general meaning may include minor shirk as well. The verse: {Allah does not forgive association with Him...} [Quran 4:48] has a general indication.â [Majmooâ Fataawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn âUthaymeen (2/203)]

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad, sallallaahu 'alyhi wa sallam, is His slave and Messenger.
Shaykh Ibn âUthaymeen   said: ""There is no harm in reciting the Quran for the woman who is in menstruation or post-partum bleeding if there is a need for this such as being a teacher or a student who is memorizing the Quran. However, reciting Quran (by touching the Musâhaf) merely for the sake of reward should not be done by a woman who is in menstruation or post-partum bleeding.

For example, somebody who you do not like is sentenced, or somebody whom you view as an extremist in the religion, or somebody who has commited a crime, or somebody whom you are envious. And would it also be disbelief if you had this feeling but you did not speak or act upon it (in the sense of harming a muslim and supporting the disbelievers)? I fear that i had those feelings and did not reject them.

All perfect praise be to Allaah, The Lord of the Worlds. I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad, sallallaahu ʻalayhi wa sallam, is His Slave and Messenger.
You should know that judging a Muslim as a disbeliever is a serious matter that should not be taken lightly. One should not hasten to label an act or statement as an act of disbelief except with relevant religious evidence. Ibn ʻUthaymeen   wrote in his treatise on Al-Walaaâ wal-Baraaâ:
âIf such an act, statement, or abandonment of a religious obligation is not proven to be an act of disbelief with a religious text (from the Quran and Sunnah), then it is impermissible for anyone to declare it an act of disbelief because this would constitute saying about Allaah that of which one has no knowledge, while Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means):
Â·    {Say, ""My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allaah that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about Allaah that which you do not know.""} [Quran 7:33]
Â·    {And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.} [Quran 17:36] 
If it is not proven that this person performs religious obligations, then it is impermissible to declare him a non-Muslim based on mere assumptions; Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means): {And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge...} [Quran 17:36]Moreover, declaring a Muslim as a non-Muslim leads to deeming shedding the blood of a person whose blood is protected by the sharee'ah allowable (which is a grave and serious matter).â [End of quote]
A mere feeling of satisfaction and relief at the punishment of a Muslim for his crime at the hands of non-Muslims does not constitute an act of disbelief. However, if this Muslim is wrongfully punished for a crime that he has not committed, then rejoicing at his punishment in this case is a kind of sin because feeling content with a sin is considered a sin. Al-Qurtubi   wrote, âAcceptance of a sin and being content with it is a sin; this is why the doer of a sin and the one who contentedly accepts it are both punished with the same punishment and both of them are ruined.â

The mere feelings to which you referred in the question are inner thoughts for which the person shall not be held accountable as long as they are mere passing thoughts that have not settled in his heart; otherwise he would be held accountable for them. An-Nawawi   wrote:
âAccording to the consensus of scholars, inner thoughts are pardoned as long as they do not settle and persist. This is because they are beyond one's control and do not appear voluntarily and one has no way of avoiding it. This is what is meant by the hadeeth that reads, 'Allaah forgives my followers their inner thoughts as long as they do not turn them into words or deeds.' Scholars highlighted that it refers to the passing thoughts that do not take root in oneâs heart. They underlined that whether such passing thoughts involve backbiting (of the heart, i.e. having evil thoughts about someone), disbelief, or anything else, they are pardoned as long as one does not yield to them, allowing them to take root in his heart. If evil inner thoughts about disbelief (non-deliberately) cross a Muslim person's mind and he hastens to repel them, then he is not declared a disbeliever and bears no sin for it ... Therefore, it is impermissible for the Muslim to indulge in or continue to think of such evil inner thoughts and dwell on them; if one experiences inner thoughts involving backbiting or other sins, then he is obliged to repel them and try to find possible interpretations for them other than their evil apparent meanings.â [Al-Athkaar]
Allaah Knows best.
