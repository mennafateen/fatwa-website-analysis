https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/66/removing-impurity,Is it essential to purify the najaasah of a dog using soil? Or can we use other means such as soap?.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    In the answer to question no. 
    41090, we have explained how 
    purification from the najaasah of a dog is done, and that it is obligatory 
    to wash it seven times, one of which should be with soil.
    The scholars differed to whether something else may be used 
    instead of soil, such as soap or other cleaning materials.
    Imam al-Shaafa’i was of the view that it is obligatory to use 
    soil, and nothing else will do, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned soil specifically and enjoined 
    using it.
    The view of Imam Ahmad is that it is permissible to use 
    something other than soil, such as soap etc.
    See: al-Majmoo’, 2/600; Rawdat al-Taalibeen, p. 
    16; al-Mughni, 1/74; al-Insaaf, 2/248.
    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (10/139): 
If a dog licks a vessel, 
    then in order for this vessel to be purified it must be washed seven times, 
    one of which must be with soil. This is according to the Hanbalis and 
    Shaafa’is. 
    If something else is used instead of soil, such as potash (a 
    substance used for cleaning in the olden days) or soap etc, or it is washed 
    eight times, the correct view is that this is not acceptable, because this 
    is the way of purification that has been enjoined in this case and we should 
    do it as instructed as a sign of obedience to Allaah, hence nothing else can 
    take its place.
    Some of the Hanbalis said that it is permissible to use 
    something else instead of soil if no soil is available, or if it will damage 
    the place to be washed. But if soil is available and it will not cause any 
    damage, then it is not permissible to use something else. This is the view 
    of Ibn Haamid. End quote.
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (1/292) concerning the view that nothing else will do instead of soil: this 
    is subject to further discussion because of the following:
    1-The Lawgiver mentioned soil in 
    particular, and it is obligatory to follow the text.

    2-Lotus leaves and potash existed 
    at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    but he did not refer to them.

    3-Perhaps there is some substance 
    in soil that kills the germs in the dog’s saliva.

    4-Soil is one of the two things 
    that purify, because it takes the place of water in the case of tayammum if 
    water is not available. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The earth has been made a place of prostration and a means 
    of purification for me.”

    The correct view is that nothing can take the place of soil, but if we assume that there is no soil available – which is an unlikely possibility – then using potash or soap is better than not using them. End quote."

      be to Allah.

      We are very happy to see among the youth of our ummah people with 
      enlightened minds and pure hearts, both young men and young women, who are 
      able to cast off the chains and fetters of division and differences, and 
      return to the purity of Islam as Allah revealed it to Muhammad (blessings 
      and peace of Allah be upon him). That is an immense and incomparable 
      blessing, because the people became divided after the time of the Prophet 
      (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) into sects and parties, each of 
      them adhering to the call of their shaykhs and imams, until Islam became 
      like a stranger among these groups and sects, despite the fact that Allah, 
      may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Verily, 
    those who divide their religion and break up into sects (all kinds of 
    religious sects), you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him)) have no concern in them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, 
    Who then will tell them what they used to do”

    [al-An‘aam 6:159]. 
We 
    congratulate you and commend your way of thinking and focusing on the most 
    important questions in life, those that have to do with religious commitment 
    and beliefs, and what a person should believe in and adhere to with regard 
    to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.
    This path begins with the first step, which you have taken on the basis of 
    what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has blessed you with of a mind 
    that is able to ponder and reflect, far removed from all previous 
    intellectual and social influences. Hence you read the Holy Qur’an far 
    removed from sectarian distortions and interpretations that detract from the 
    clarity of the text and deprive the reader of its benefits. So you ponder 
    the word of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, that He sent down to 
    guide mankind and enlighten humanity, and you will inevitably find therein 
    guidance and enlightenment for yourself too, in clear and straightforward 
    words in most of its verses and chapters. So you read therein the words of 
    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent 
    down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you 
    may receive mercy (i.e. saved from the torment of Hell)”

    [al-An‘aam 6:155]

    “(This is the) Book (the Quran) sent down unto you (O 
    Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), so let not your heart 
    be troubled about it, that you warn thereby, and a reminder unto the 
    believers.

    (Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) 
    to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:) Follow what has been sent 
    down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’an and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and 
    follow not any Awliya (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to 
    associate partners in worship with Allah), besides Him (Allah). Little do 
    you remember”

    [al-A‘raaf 7:2-3]. 
As 
    guidance is connected to following the Holy Qur’an and following Allah’s 
    noble Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then 
    what guidance could you find after that in the opinions and views of human 
    beings? What happiness could we seek other than in the noble Book and the 
    Prophet’s Sunnah?
    Why would we introduce intermediaries between us and these two lights? Do we 
    not have minds with which to think? Has Allah may He be glorified and 
    exalted, not created for us hearts with which to distinguish between truth 
    and falsehood? So why do we persist in imitating that with which we may have 
    grown up of sectarian notions or esoteric factions?
    Where do we find these factions in the Book of Allah, and where do we find 
    them in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him)? 
Do 
    you think that we will enter Hell if we do not believe in a particular imam 
    or a particular sect?
    Does it make sense to suggest that we will enter Hell if we do not believe 
    in things that neither the Holy Qur’an nor the noble Prophet Muhammad 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught us?
    These are very few simple questions that will lead us to cast away all these 
    sects and factions and weird beliefs, and to become certain of the path that 
    we follow, far away from them and closer to the pure Tawheed (affirmation of 
    the Oneness of Allah) that is the religion of all of the Prophets (peace be 
    upon them).
    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    “Say: ‘Obey 
    Allah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) is only responsible for the duty 
    placed on him (i.e. to convey Allah’s Message) and you for that placed on 
    you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messengers 
    duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a 
    plain way).’”

    [an-Noor 24:54]

    “And 
    whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him)) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) , 
    and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”

    [al-Hashr 59:7].
    Moreover you should understand that the teachings of Islam do not instruct 
    you to give up studying for fear that your husband may force you to work. 
    The husband has no right to force his wife to do that, and by the same token 
    he has no right to your wealth or property. Rather you can stipulate (in 
    your marriage contract) whatever is appropriate for you and your situation. 
    If you both agree that you can work in an appropriate environment, there is 
    nothing wrong with that, so long as you strive to adhere to Islamic 
    guidelines. 
If 
    you yourself do not want to work, then no one has the right to stipulate 
    that you must do that, and you have the right to state that and stipulate 
    whatever you wish to anyone who proposes marriage to you, so long as you do 
    not make that a barrier that prevents you from getting married. Rather you 
    should strive to maintain your chastity by getting married and choose for 
    yourself a righteous husband who will take you from the environment, beliefs 
    and traditions with which you have grown up and help you to adhere to the 
    true and pure religion. It is not essential that his outward appearance 
    should be such that it would cause your family to reject him; rather it is 
    sufficient that he should be of good character and generally acceptable in 
    terms of religious commitment, one who is keen to follow his religion and 
    who prays regularly. 
If 
    you want to delay postgraduate study until after marriage, then you know 
    best what is appropriate for you. But if you want to complete your studies, 
    whilst striving to reduce things that are contrary to Islamic teachings to 
    the best of your ability, and you are keen to pray on time so that the time 
    for prayer does not end before you offer the prayer, except in exceptional 
    circumstances and emergencies, then do that, and we hope that there will be 
    nothing wrong with you doing that, in sha Allah.
    Going out of the house does not require a mahram; rather it is in the case 
    of travel that that is required, especially if you adhere to hijab and 
    proper conduct, and there is no danger posed by aggressors.
    But if you fear for yourself, that you may be subject to aggression, or you 
    fear losing your religious commitment, or you are not able to observe hijab 
    or adhere to the guidelines of your religion, then give precedence to all of 
    that over the interests of work.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/132/hukm-al-hajj-wal-umrah-rulings-on-hajj-and-umrah,"What is the meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.”

[al-Baqarah 2:197]?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    In this verse Allaah mentions some of the rulings and etiquette that have to do with Hajj. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the 
    well-known (lunar year) months” 
i.e., the time  for Hajj is the well-known 
    months which are Shawwaal, Dhu’l-Qa’dah and the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah. Some of the scholars were of the view that the whole of 
    Dhu’l-Hijjah is one of the months of Hajj. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj 
    therein” 
i.e., whoever enters ihraam for that, because 
    when a person enters ihraam for Hajj, he has to complete it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform properly (i.e. all the 
    ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah”
[al-Baqarah 2:196]
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“then he should not have sexual relations 
    (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj” 
i.e., when he has entered ihraam for Hajj, he must respect it and protect it from everything 
    that may spoil it or detract from it, of sexual relations, sin and argument. 
Rafath 
    (translated here as sexual relations) means intercourse and everything that leads up to it of both words and deeds, such as kissing, speaking 
    about intercourse and desire, etc. 
The word rafath is also used to refer 
    to obscene speech. 
Fusooq (sin) 
    means all kinds of disobedience and sin, such as disobeying one’s parents, severing ties of kinship, consuming riba, consuming orphans’ property, 
    backbiting and gossiping, etc. It also includes the things that are forbidden during ihraam. 
Jidaal (dispute) 
    means arguing and debating with no just basis. It is not permissible for the person who has entered ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah to argue with no 
    basis. 
With regard to debating in a good manner in 
    order to explain the truth, this is something that is enjoined by Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the 
    Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better”
[al-Nahl 16:125]
Although these things – obscene speech, sin 
    and false arguments – are not allowed at any time or in any place, the prohibition is even more emphatic during Hajj, because the purpose of Hajj 
    is to be humble before Allaah and to draw closer to Him by means of the acts of worship as much as possible, and to keep away from evil deeds. 
    Thus one's Hajj will be accepted, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise. 
We ask Allaah to help us to remember Him, 
    give thanks to Him and to worship Him properly.
 And Allaah knows best.

My qusetion is about wudo/ablution i am unable to grip with my hands.I have a health care provider in the morning after fajr who gives me a full bath daily is this sufficent for the whole day i tried clean dust or sand but could not wipe face completly and had a hard time putting hands in sand/dust please give advice.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    1 – Islam came to make things easy for people and not to 
    burden them with things they cannot do. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):
    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets 
    reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that 
    (evil) which he has earned”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]

    Allaah has enjoined wudoo’ upon the Muslims, but because He 
    knows that some of them are weak and unable to do it, He has granted them a 
    concession and has prescribed tayammum as an alternative to water, and made 
    it a means of purification for the Muslim.
    But if it is too difficult to do tayammum, then it is 
    permissible to pray without wudoo’ and without tayammum. This is like the 
    case of one who cannot find a garment to cover his awrah in prayer; it is 
    permissible for him to pray without a garment.
    If someone can help you to do ghusl or wduoo’, then all well 
    and good, and that will suffice you for the rest of the day so long as you 
    do not break that wudoo’ in any way.
    If you do tayammum for yourself or if someone else does it 
    for you, it is sufficient to pass your hand over the dust, and wipe whatever 
    you can of your face.
    You may also – because of hardship and sickness – put two 
    prayers together if it is difficult for you to do wudoo’ at the time of the 
    second prayer.
    If it is not easy for you to do wudoo’ or tayammum until the 
    time for the prayer is nearly over, then you have to pray even if you did 
    not purify yourself with either water or dust.
    The evidence that it is permissible for a man to pray even if 
    he cannot purify himself is as follows:
    It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah borrowed a necklace from 
    ‘Asma’ and lost it. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) sent a man to find it, then the time for prayer came but 
    they did not have any water, so they prayed then complained about that to 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
    Then Allaah revealed the verse of tayammum. Usayd ibn Hudayr said to 
    ‘Aa’ishah, “May Allaah reward you with good, for by Allaah there has never 
    happened to you anything that you dislike but Allaah brought something good 
    for you and for the Muslims through it.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 329; Muslim, 367)
    In a report narrated by al-Tabaraani and Abu ‘Awwaanah, it 
    states clearly that they prayed without wudoo’.
    It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Usayd ibn Hudayr and 
    some others to look for a necklace that ‘Aa’ishah had lost. The time for 
    prayer came and they prayed without wudoo’. When they came to the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) they complained to him 
    about that, then the verse of tayammum was revealed.” Al-Nufayli added: And 
    Usayd ibn Hudayr said: “May Allaah reward you with good, for by Allaah there 
    has never happened to you anything that you dislike but Allaah granted 
    relief for you and for the Muslims through it.” 

    Narrated by Abu Awwaanah, 873; al-Tabaraani, 131.
    This indicates that in the absence of water – which was the 
    only means of purification before tayammum – it is permissible to pray 
    without wudoo’, so it is more apt that it is permissible to pray in the 
    absence of dust which is of a lower status than water.
    From this it may be understood that the person who is unable 
    to purify himself – whether that is because there is no means of 
    purification or because he is unable to find it or is unable to use it if it 
    is present – is permitted to pray without purifying himself.
    Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled, 
    Baab idha lam yajid maa’an wa laa turaaban (Chapter: if there is no 
    water or dust).
    Ibn Rasheed said: It is as if the author is stating that 
    tayammum is not prescribed if there is no dust, and that was after tayammum 
    had been prescribed. It is as if he is saying that their ruling concerning 
    the lack of the means of purification – which was water only – was the same 
    as our ruling on cases when neither of the two means of purification, water 
    and dust, is available. Hence we know that this hadeeth is suited to the 
    heading, even though the hadeeth does not say that they had no dust, rather 
    it says that they had no water. This indicates that prayer is obligatory for 
    the one who has neither of the two means of purification, because the 
    hadeeth shows that they prayed believing that it was obligatory to do so. If 
    praying in such circumstances were not allowed, then the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have told them off for doing so. 
    This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad, the majority of muhadditheen and 
    most of the companions of Maalik.

    Fath al-Baari, 1/440.
    Ibn al-Qayyim said:
    If no dust is available, this is as if tayammum is not 
    prescribed, and there is no difference. They prayed without doing tayammum 
    because tayammum had not been prescribed at that time. The same applies to 
    one who prays without tayammum because he does not have the material with 
    which to do tayammum. What is the difference between not having it and it 
    not being prescribed? According to analogy (qiyaas) and the Sunnah, the one 
    who does not have it should pray according to his circumstances, for Allaah 
    does not burden any soul beyond its scope. And he should not repeat the 
    prayer, because he did what he was commanded to do so he does not have to 
    repeat it. This is similar to the case of one who does not stand or face the 
    qiblah or cover himself or recite because he is unable to do so. This is 
    what is implied by the texts and by analogy.
    Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Tahdheeb Sunan Abi Dawood, 
    1/61.
    Ibn Qudaamah said:
    Because it is one of the conditions of prayer which is waived 
    when one is unable to do it, as is the case with all the other conditions 
    and pillars (essential parts) of the prayer. And he did what he was obliged 
    to do as best he could, so he does not have to repeat it. This is like the 
    one who is unable to cover himself and prays naked; or one who is unable to 
    face the qiblah so he prays facing a different direction; or one who is 
    unable to stand so he prays sitting.
    Al-Mughni, 1/157.
    Al-Shawkaani said:
    With regard to the phrase “so they prayed without wudoo’”, a 
    number of scholars, including the compiler, understood this to mean that it 
    is obligatory to pray even if neither of the two means of purification, 
    water and dust, is available. It does not say in the hadeeth that they had 
    no dust, rather it says only that they had no water, but the lack of water 
    at that time was like the lack of water and dust, because there was no means 
    of purification other than water. The point is that they prayed believing it 
    to be obligatory to do so. If prayer in such circumstances were not allowed, 
    then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have 
    told them off for doing so. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad, the 
    majority of muhadditheen and most of the companions of Maalik.

     Nayl al-Awtaar, 1/337.
    This is what the scholars said about this issue, and it is 
    the most correct view. 

     The ruling in your case is like that of one who cannot find 
    water or dust, if you cannot find someone to do tayammum for you and you are 
    unable to do it yourself.

     And Allaah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/263/biography-of-the-prophet,How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) interact with his companions?,"Praise be to Allah.
The Prophet’s interactions with his companions were in accordance with what Allah enjoined upon him, as He, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So by mercy from Allah, [O Muhammad], you were lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:159].
This verse urged the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to do three things when interacting with his companions:
Firstly:
To be compassionate and lenient towards them, and to overlook their mistakes.
This is how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was with his companions.
Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful”
[at-Tawbah 9:128].
One example of his compassion was that he would be kind to them and would be patient in teaching them or in bearing the roughness and harshness of some of those who were accustomed to behaving in such ways.
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (sa) (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was wearing a Najraani cloak with a thick border. A Bedouin came up to him and grabbed him roughly by his cloak, and I could see the marks left on the neck of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by the border of his cloak, because of the rough manner in which he grabbed him. Then he said: O Muhammad! Order that I be given some of the wealth of Allah that is with you! The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) turned to him and smiled, then he ordered that he be given something.
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6088) and Muslim (1057).
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that a Bedouin urinated in the mosque, and the people leapt up to sort him out, but the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to them: “Let him be, and throw a bucket of water over his urine, for you have been sent to make things easy, and you have not been sent to make things difficult.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6128).
It was narrated that Mu‘aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami said: Whilst I was praying with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), a man among the people sneezed and I said: Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you). The people glared at me and I said: May my mother be bereft of me! Why are you staring at me? They started striking their hands on their thighs, and when I realized that they were telling me to be quiet, (I felt angry) but I kept quiet. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had prayed – may my father and mother be sacrificed for him; by Allah I have never seen a better teacher or better teachings before or since; he did not rebuke me, hit me or revile me – he said: “This prayer is not the right place for any of the people’s speech, rather it is tasbeeh, takbeer and recitation of Qur’an…” Narrated by Muslim (537).
Another example of his compassion towards them was that he would often smile at them.
It was narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abdillah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) never refused me permission to enter since I became Muslim, and he never looked at me without a smile. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6089) and Muslim (2475).
It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn al-Haarith ibn Jaz’ said: I never saw anyone who smiled more than the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3641); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi.
He never expressed anger or toughness except when required in order to please Allah, may He be exalted, and to protect the religious commitment of his companions.
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he would choose the easier of them, so long as it was not a sin. If it was a sin, then it would be the further of the two from him. By Allah, he never sought vengeance for his own sake, unless the sacred limits of Allah were transgressed, in which case he would seek vengeance for the sake of Allah. Narrated by Muslim (6786).
Secondly:
He used to pray for forgiveness for his companions, and for anyone who angered him or upset him.
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “O Allah, Muhammad is only human, and he gets angry as any human being gets angry. I am making a covenant with You that You will never break. I am only human, so any believer whom I harm, revile or flog, make it an expiation and a means by which he will draw close to You on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6361) and Muslim (2601).
Thirdly:
He would not make a decision on his own regarding any matter that required referring to people of experience and wisdom. He used to consult his companions and involve them in the decision-making, in obedience to the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning):
“…and consult them in the matter”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:159].
Ibn Katheer said:
Hence the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to consult his companions concerning matters when they arose, out of kindness towards them, so that they would be more motivated to do what they had decided upon. For example, he consulted them on the day of Badr about going after the caravan, and they said: O Messenger of Allah, if you were to ask us to cross the sea, we would cross it with you; if you were to take us to Bark al-Ghumaad, we would go there with you. We will not say to you as the people of Moosaa said to him: “So go, you and your Lord, and fight. Indeed, we are remaining right here”. Rather we say: Go, for we are with you, in front of you, on your right and on your left, fighting alongside you.
He also consulted them as to where they should halt, and al-Mundhir ibn ‘Amr suggested moving forward. And he consulted them at Uhud as to whether he should stay in Madinah or go out to confront the enemy, and the majority of them suggested that he should go out to confront them, so he did that.
On the day of al-Khandaq he consulted them about making a peace deal with the Ahzaab (confederates) in return for one-third of the harvest of Madinah in that year, but the two Sa‘ds – Sa‘d ibn Mu‘aadh and Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah – rejected the idea, so he did not do that.
On the day of al-Hudaybiyah, he consulted them about attacking the mushrikeen (polytheists), and Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq said to him: We have not come to fight anyone; rather we have come to do ‘umrah, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted his view.
The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said during the incident of the slander (al-ifk): “Advise me, O Muslims, about people who speak ill of about my family and make accusations about them, for by Allah I know nothing bad about my family, and they speak ill of a man of whom, by Allah, I know nothing but good.” And ‘Ali and Usaamah suggested that he should divorce ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her).
The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to consult them with regard to war and other matters.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/242/animal-rights,Is it haram to keep Pet fish? and also I heard somewhere that the dog was created from the dirt taken from the area of the belly button where Satan spat on Adam (AS)?,"Praise 
          be to Allaah. 
There 
          is nothing wrong with keeping animals for which there is no Islamic 
          prohibition on keeping them (such as dogs and pigs). There are reports 
          in the Sunnah which indicate that some of the Sahaabah kept permissible 
          animals for farming purposes or for fun and for pleasure. 
It was 
          narrated from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he had a young 
          brother who had a nughar (a small bird or nightingale). The bird died, 
          and the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him looking sad and 
          grieved, so he joked with him, and said to him words which implied approval 
          of his keeping this bird. The Prophet 
          
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “O Abu Umayr, 
          what happened to the nughayr?” 
And the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that a woman entered 
          Hell because of a cat “which she did not feed, neither did she let it 
          eat from the vermin of the earth.” From this it may be understood that 
          if she had fed it, she would have been saved from that threat. 
And it 
          was said that Abu Hurayrah was so called because of a cat (hirr, dim. 
          hurayrah) which used to accompany him. 
So keeping 
          permissible animals, so long as you do not neglect them, is something 
          which is permitted and it may even be one of the means of earning reward, 
          as the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “In every living being 
          there is reward.” But if you keep animals and neglect and abuse them, 
          it may be one of the means that lead to sin and the threat of Hell, 
          as in the hadeeth about the woman who neglected her cat until it died. 
We would 
          also like to point out that Islam preceded both western and eastern 
          organizations in proclaiming the rights of women, animals, workers, 
          employers and so on. Indeed, the greatest rights which it proclaimed 
          are the rights of Allaah over His creation and the rights of people 
          over Allaah. 
We would 
          also point out that care and concern for human beings should take precedence 
          over the care of animals, and that the reward for that is greater. [The 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:] “Ward off the Fire 
          even with half a date [i.e., by giving half a date in charity]” and 
          “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be like these two in Paradise” 
          – and he gestured with his index finger and the one next to it. And 
          there are other similar ahaadeeth from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
On this 
          basis, there is nothing wrong with your keeping fish as you mentioned 
          in your question, so long as you take care of feeding them and avoiding 
          anything that could cause their death. And Allaah knows best. 
With regard 
          to the creation of dogs, Allaah created them as He created all other 
          animals; it is not permissible to claim that dogs were created from 
          any specific substance without having evidence for that. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and 
          we testify not except according to what we know”[Yoosuf 12:81]
With regard to Iblees, 
          Allaah commanded him to prostrate to Adam and he refused and was arrogant, 
          then what he did was to tempt Adam to eat from the tree from which he 
          had been forbidden to eat. There was no kind of dirt, and Allaah knows 
          best. I do not know anything of the argument which you mentioned. 
One aspect 
          of the Qur’aanic guidance is that it mentioned the knowledge which the 
          Muslim needs in this world and in the Hereafter; with regard to knowledge 
          for which there is no need, the Qur’aan does not mention it, so as to 
          teach the Muslims to focus on beneficial knowledge and to ignore everything 
          else. For example, the Qur’aanic text does not mention the colour of 
          the dog which belonged to the People of the Cave, or the kind of wood from which the ship (ark) of Nooh was built, and other matters which are irrelevant and produce no beneficial knowledge or belief. Perhaps speaking of the substance from which dogs were created comes under the same heading. And Allaah knows best."

    Allaah has 
    commanded the Muslim to protect himself and his family from the Fire. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you 
    who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) 
    whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) 
    severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from 
    Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”

    [al-Tahreem 66:6]
Allaah has put the wife 
    and children under the care and protection of the husband, and he will be 
    asked about them on the Day of Resurrection. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The 
    ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock; the man is the 
    shepherd of his family members and is responsible for them; the woman is the 
    shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for them; 
    the slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. 
    Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 853; Muslim, 1829. 
Allaah has 
    warned those who betray this trust and do not protect their families as 
    required, that they will be denied Paradise. It was narrated that Ma’qal ibn 
    Yassaar said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “There is no person whom Allaah appoints in charge of some 
    flock and he is not sincere towards them, but he will not smell the 
    fragrance of Paradise.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 6731; Muslim, 142. 
What this 
    husband is doing, watching pornographic movies, is an evil and a great sin. 
    It is not permissible for him to do that, let alone force someone else to do 
    it. 
If the 
    husband calls his wife to watch these movies, it is not permissible for her 
    to obey him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “There is no obedience if it involves disobeying Allaah, rather 
    obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.” Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari, 7257; Muslim, 1840. 
The 
    husband’s threat of divorce does not count as a legitimate excuse for her, 
    and is not regarded as her being forced to do it. Rather she should advise 
    him in the way that is better. If he responds and gives up the evil that he 
    is doing, this is something good that he is doing for himself, and she will 
    be rewarded for that. If he refuses to respond to the command of Allaah to 
    lower the gaze and avoid looking at haraam things, then it is not 
    permissible for her to obey him in committing sin, and she should not trust 
    him with regard to herself or her children, and Allaah will compensate her 
    with someone better than him, in sha Allaah. 
In the 
    answer to question no.

    guiding this husband. 
If the

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/196/medicine-and-medical-treatments,"Is cupping on Saturday or Friday makrooh if it happens to be the 17th, 19th or 21st, as mentioned in the hadith “Do not do cupping on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays”? This has become something that is regarded as important among the Muslims in Britain. I hope that you can explain: are these hadiths da‘eef or saheeh?","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:
	There are many hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
	upon him) about the timing of cupping, which refer to his words or actions. 
	They may be divided into two categories: 
1.

	Hadiths which state the preferred days for cupping, which are the 
	seventeenth – especially if it happens to be a Tuesday – the nineteenth and 
	the twenty-first of the lunar month, and Mondays and Thursdays among the 
	days of the week. 
2.

	Hadiths which forbid cupping on certain days of the week, namely Saturday, 
	Sunday and Tuesday. There are also hadiths which encourage doing cupping on 
	Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
	Most of the leading scholars have stated that all the hadiths in these two 
	categories are da‘eef and not one of them is soundly narrated from the 
	Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). There follow some of 
	their statements:
	1.Imam Maalik was 
	asked about cupping on Saturdays and Wednesdays, and he said:

	There is nothing wrong with that; there is no day on which I have not had 
	cupping done, and I do not regard any of that as makrooh. End quote.
	Al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’ 
	(7/225), quoted from al-‘Atabiyyah 

	 It says in al-Fawaakih ad-Dawaani (2/338), which is a Maaliki book:

	(Cupping is permissible) on all days, even Saturdays and Wednesdays. In fact 
	Maalik deliberately used to have cupping done on those days, and he did not 
	regard any kind of medical treatment as makrooh on those two days. The 
	hadiths which warn against cupping on those days were not regarded as saheeh 
	by Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him). End quote.
	2.‘Abd ar-Rahmaan 
	ibn Mahdi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

	There is no saheeh report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
	upon him) concerning the timing of cupping; however he enjoined doing it. 
	End quote.
	Narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo‘aat (3/215)
	3.Al-Khallaal 
	narrated from Imam Ahmad that the hadith is not proven.

	Narrated by Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (10/149)
	4.Al-Bardha‘i said:
I 
	saw Abu Zar‘ah not confirming any hadith about cupping being makrooh on a 
	particular day or being mustahabb on a particular day. End quote.
	Su’aalaat al-Bardha‘i 
	(2/575)
	5.Al-Haafiz Ibn 
	Hajar said, commenting on the words of Imam al-Bukhaari, “Chapter on what 
	time cupping should be done, and Abu Moosa had cupping done at night”

	Concerning the suitable times for cupping, there are hadiths none of which 
	meet his (al-Bukhaari’s) conditions. It is as he was indicating that it may 
	be done when needed, and it is not restricted to one time rather than 
	another, because he mentioned cupping being done at night. End quote.
	Fath al-Baari 
	(10/149)
	6.Al-‘Aqeeli (may 
	Allah have mercy on him) said:
No 
	report has been proven sound about this matter – i.e., the best day for 
	cupping. End quote.
	Ad-Du‘afa’ al-Kabeer 
	(1/150)
	7.Ibn al-Jawzi (may 
	Allah have mercy on him) included some chapters in his book al-Mawdoo‘aat 
	(3/211-215) in which he compiled these hadiths on this topic, after which he 
	said:

	None of these hadiths are saheeh. End quote.
	8.Imam an-Nawawi 
	(may Allah have mercy on him) said:
To 
	sum up, nothing is proven about the prohibition on cupping on particular 
	days. End quote.
	al-Majmoo‘ 
	(9/69).
	However, an-Nawawi classed as hasan the hadith about doing cupping on the 
	seventeenth, nineteenth and twenty-first (of the lunar month).
	Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	None of these hadiths is saheeh. End quote.
	Fath al-Baari 
	(10/149)
	Secondly:
	Many of the scholars regarded it as mustahabb to do cupping on the 
	seventeenth, nineteenth and twenty-first of the lunar month, based on a 
	number of points of evidence:
	1.That was narrated 
	with saheeh isnaads from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them):
It 
	was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said:
	The Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
	used to do cupping on the odd-numbered days of the month.
	Narrated by at-Tabaraani in Tahdheeb al-Athaar (no. 2856). He said: 
	Muhammad ibn Bashshaar told us: Abu Dawood told us: Hishaam told us, from 
	Qataadah, from Anas.
	This is a saheeh isnaad. Abu Zar‘ah said: The best report concerning it is 
	the hadith of Anas: The companions of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him) used to do cupping on the seventeenth, 
	nineteenth and twenty-first.

	Su’aalaat al-Bardha‘i 
	(2/757)
	After the report mentioned above, at-Tabari also narrated that Rafee‘ 
	Abu’l-‘Aaliyah said: They used to regard it as mustahabb to do cupping on 
	odd-numbered days of the month. 
It 
	was narrated that Ibn ‘Awn said: Some of his companions used to advise doing 
	cupping on the seventeenth and nineteenth. Ahmad said: Sulaym said: Hishaam 
	told us, from Muhammad, that he added: and the twenty-first.
	Perhaps the Sahaabah learned that from the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
	Allah be upon him), which gives the impression that these hadiths were 
	originally marfoo‘. In fact some of the scholars are of the view that some 
	of the marfoo‘ hadiths concerning that are qawiy, such as Imam at-Tirmidhi 
	when he narrated the hadith of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with 
	him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) used to have cupping done on the two veins at the side of the neck and 
	between the shoulder blades, and he used to have cupping done on the 
	seventeenth, nineteenth and twenty-first. (No. 2051). He (at-Tirmidhi) said: 
	A hasan hadith.
	Some of the later scholars did likewise, such as as-Suyooti in al-Haawi 
	li’l-Fataawa (1/279-280); Ibn Hajar al-Haytami in al-Fataawa 
	(4/351); and Shaykh al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (no. 622, 
	1847).
	However the texts that we have mentioned above from the imams, which 
	described the marfoo‘ report as da‘eef, are more likely to be correct.
	2.That is also 
	supported from a medical point of view:

	Al-‘Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said – after 
	narrating the hadiths that speak of doing cupping on the seventeenth, 
	nineteenth and twenty-first –:

	These hadiths are in accordance with what is agreed upon among doctors, 
	which is that cupping in the second half and third quarter of the month is 
	more beneficial than in the first half and last quarter.

	However, if it is used when there is a need for it, then it is beneficial at 
	any time, whether that is at the beginning of the month or the end.

	Al-Khallaal said: ‘Usmah ibn ‘Isaam told me: Hanbal told us: Abu ‘Abdullah 
	Ahmad ibn Hanbal used to have cupping done at any time he felt the need, at 
	any hour of the day. End quote.

	Zaad al-Ma‘aad 
	(4/54)

	But with regard to choosing days of the week for cupping, nothing is proven 
	concerning that from a medical point of view, as far as we know, although 
	there are reports from some of the Sahaabah concerning that. It is proven 
	from Imam Ahmad that he used to avoid cupping on Saturdays and Wednesdays. 
	That was narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/54) from al-Khallaal.

	Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

	Cupping is makrooh on Saturdays and Wednesdays. This was stated in a report 
	of Abu Taalib and a number of others. Ahmad added the report of Muhammad ibn 
	al-Hasan ibn Hassaan. They also mentioned Fridays. This is what was stated 
	definitively in al-Mustaw‘ab and elsewhere.

	Al-Marwadhi said: Abu ‘Abdullah used to have cupping done on Sundays and 
	Tuesdays.

	Al-Qaadi said: It is clear that Sundays and Tuesdays are preferred, and 
	Saturdays and Wednesdays are disliked. Nothing was said about Fridays. End 
	quote.
It 
	was narrated from az-Zuhri in a mursal report: “Whoever has cupping done on 
	a Saturday or a Wednesday, and is afflicted with leprosy, let him blame no 
	one but himself.”

	This was mentioned by Ahmad and quoted as evidence. Abu Dawood said: Its 
	isnaad is not saheeh.

	Al-Bayhaqi said that it was regarded as mawsool by more than one scholar, 
	but he regarded that as incorrect. Rather it is munqati‘ (interrupted). End 
	quote.
It 
	was narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah with his isnaad from Mak-hool in a 
	mursal report. 

	Ahmad was told that a man was treated with cupping on a Wednesday and he 
	took the hadith lightly and said: What is this hadith? Then he was afflicted 
	with leprosy. Ahmad said: No one should take the hadith lightly. This was 
	narrated by al-Khallaal.
It 
	was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar in a marfoo‘ report: “On Friday there is an hour 
	when no one is treated with cupping but he is exposed to a disease from 
	which there is no healing.”

	Narrated by al-Bayhaqi with a hasan isnaad. It includes ‘Ataaf ibn Khaalid, 
	in whom there is some weakness. End quote.

	Al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah 
	by Ibn Muflih (3/333)

	Something similar was also narrated from Ibn Ma‘een and ‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/109/seeing-the-new-moon,Why are the Muslims not united in their fasting even though there is only one new moon for Ramadaan? In the past there was the excuse of there being no media or means of communication.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
      
      Firstly:
    The most likely reason for the differences in the start of 
    the fast from one country to another is the difference in sighting the new 
    moon. Such differences are well known and it makes sense that there are such 
    differences.
    Based on this, it is not possible to expect all the Muslims 
    to start fasting at the same time, because this would mean that some of them 
    were starting to fast before the new moon had been sighted and even before 
    it had appeared.
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about those who call for the ummah to be united in fasting and for the 
    moon sighting to be based on its sighting in Makkah. He said:
    This is impossible from an astronomical point of view, 
    because the sighting of the new moon, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, 
    differs, according to the scientists who are well-versed in this field. 
    Because it differs, then each country should have its own ruling, according 
    to the reports and according to science.
    The evidence from reports is the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night 
    of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm 
    (fasts) that month”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]

    If it so happens that people in a remote region of the world 
    do not see the new moon whereas the people of Makkah do see it, then how can 
    the words of this verse apply to those who have not seen the new moon? The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when 
    you see it and stop fasting when you see it.” (Agreed upon). So if the 
    people of Makkah, for example, see it, then how can we expect the people of 
    Pakistan and countries further east to start fasting, when we know that that 
    the new moon has not yet appeared in their region, and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) connected the start of fasting 
    to the sighting of the moon?

     The scientific evidence is the correct analogy which we 
    cannot contradict. We know that dawn appears in eastern regions of the earth 
    before it appears in western regions, so if dawn has appeared in eastern 
    regions, do we have to stop eating even though it is still night where we 
    are? The answer is no. If the sun has set in eastern regions but it is still 
    day where we are, is it permissible for us to break our fast? The answer is 
    no. And the new moon is exactly like the sun, except that the timing of the 
    new moon is monthly and the timing of the sun is daily.  The One Who said 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn 
    appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then 
    complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”

    [al-Baqarah 2:187] is also the 
    One Who said (interpretation of the meaning):
    “So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night 
    of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm 
    (fasts) that month”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]

    So the evidence of both the texts and science indicates that 
    we should establish a separate ruling for each place when it comes to 
    starting and ending the fast, and this should be connected to the physical 
    sign which Allaah has described in His Book and which His Prophet Muhammad 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) established in his Sunnah, 
    namely the sighting of the moon and the sighting of the sun or dawn.
    End quote from Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 451.
    And he said, explaining this analogy and supporting the 
    argument of those who say that there should be different moon sightings:
    They say that the monthly timings should be like the daily 
    sightings. Just as different countries vary in the start and end of the fast 
    each day, so too they must differ in the start and end of the month-long 
    fast. The difference in daily timings is well known according to Muslim 
    consensus; those who are in the east start fasting before those who are in 
    the west, and they also break the fast first.
    If we accept the differences in sighting with regard to daily 
    timings, then we should also accept it with regard to the month.
    No one can say that the verse “and eat and drink until the 
    white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread 
    (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall” 
    and the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) “When the night has come from here and the day has departed from here 
    and the sun has set, then the faster may break his fast” are general in 
    meaning and apply to all the Muslims in every region.
    The same applies to the verse “So whoever of you sights 
    (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present 
    at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month” and the words of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “When you see 
    it fast and when you see it stop fasting.” 

    As you see, this opinion is very strong, and the analogy is 
    sound, the analogy between the monthly timing and the daily timing.
    End quote from Fataawa Ramadaan, compiled by Ashraf 
    ‘Abd al-Maqsood, p. 104
    The Council of Senior Scholars issued an important statement 
    on this topic, the text of which is as follows:
    Firstly: The difference in moon sighting is something which 
    is well known, and there is no difference among the scholars concerning 
    this. Rather the difference of scholarly opinion has to do with whether the 
    difference in moon sighting matters or not.
    Secondly: The issue of whether the difference in moon 
    sighting matters or not is a theoretical matter in which there is room for 
    ijtihaad. Even people of great knowledge and piety differed concerning this 
    matter. This is a type of difference which is acceptable, where the one who 
    makes ijtihaad and gets it right will have two rewards, one for his ijtihaad 
    and the other for getting it right, and the one who gets it wrong will be 
    rewarded for his ijtihaad.
    The scholars differed concerning this matter and there are 
    two points of view. One is that the difference in moon sighting matters and 
    the other is that it does not matter. Each group quotes evidence from the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, and sometimes they quote the same text, such as when 
    they both quote the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you (O 
    Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of 
    time for mankind and for the pilgrimage”

    [al-Baqarah 2:189]

    and the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see 
    it.”

     That is because of different understandings of the texts, 
    and different ways in which each group derives evidence from them.
    Based on the considerations that the Council has seen and 
    examined, and based on the fact that the difference of opinion on this 
    matter does not have any effect that may lead to undesirable consequences, 
    since this religion appeared fourteen centuries ago and we do not know of 
    any period during which the ummah was united in moon sighting, the members 
    of the Council of Senior Scholars think that matters should be left as they 
    are and that this subject should not be stirred up. Each Islamic state 
    should have the right to choose whichever opinion it wishes, based on the 
    suggestions of its own scholars, because each view has its evidence and 
    proofs.
    Thirdly: The Council has studied the issue of proving the new 
    moon by means of calculation, and what has been narrated in the Qur’aan and 
    Sunnah, and they have studied the comments of the scholars on this matter. 
    They have decided unanimously that astronomical calculations carry no weight 
    in determining the new moon with regard to Islamic matters, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Fast when 
    you see it and stop fasting when you see it.” And he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not fast until you see it, and do 
    not stop fasting until you see it.” And because of other evidence to that 
    effect.

I really want to know more about Islam but every time I know something new, I get suspicious about it Bravely, I would like to know if it is correct that the Coran permits a man to his wife? If that’s true how could you explain that?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
         
    We are very happy that you are reading our site and are keen to learn about Islam. 
    We ask Allaah to guide you to that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the hereafter. 
There is nothing in the Qur’aan that suggests that a man is allowed to bite his 
    wife. 
1 – The Qur’aan enjoins good treatment of one's wife: she is to be honoured and 
    treated kindly, even when one no longer feels love in one's heart towards her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike 
    a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good”
[al-Nisa’ 4:19] 
2 – The Qur’aan explains that women have rights over their 
    husbands, just as their husbands have rights over them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) 
    similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) 
    over them. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
[al-Baqarah 2:228] 
This verse indicates that the man has additional rights, commensurate with his 
    role as protector and maintainer and his responsibility of spending (on his wife) etc. 
3 – The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined kind 
    treatment and honouring of one’s wife, and he described the best of people as those who are best to their wives. He said: “The best of you are 
    those who are the best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Maajah, 1977; classed as saheeh 
    by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
4 – The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke beautiful 
    word concerning kind treatment of one’s wife, stating that when the husband feeds his wife and puts a morsel of food in her mouth, he earns the 
    reward of doing an act of charity. He said, “You never spend anything but you will be rewarded for it, even the morsel of food that you lift to 
    your wife’s mouth.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6352; Muslim, 1628. 
4 – And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allaah and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the 
    words of Allaah. Your right over them is that they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike; if they do that then hit 
    them but not in a harsh manner. And their right over you is that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 1218. 
What is meant by “they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you 
    dislike” is that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses, whether the person disliked is a man or a woman, or any of 
    the woman’s mahrams [close relatives to whom marriage is forbidden]. The prohibition includes all of them. From the words of al-Nawawi. 
The hadeeth may be understood as meaning that a man has the right to hit his wife, 
    in a manner that is not harsh and does not cause injury if if there is a reason for that, such as her going against his wishes or disobeying him. 
This is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As to those women on whose part you see ill‑conduct, admonish them (first), 
    (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means 
    (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great”
[al-Nisa’ 4:34] 
If a woman rebels against her husband and disobeys his commands, 
    then he should follow this method of admonishing her, forsaking her in bed and hitting her. Hitting is subject to the condition that it should not 
    be harsh or cause injury. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: this means that it should not cause pain. 
‘Ata’ said: I said to Ibn ‘Abbaas, what is the kind of hitting that is not harsh? 
    He said, Hitting with a siwaak and the like. [A siwaak is a small stick or twig used for cleaning the teeth - Translator] 
The purpose behind this is not to hurt or humiliate the woman, rather it is 
    intended to make her realize that she has transgressed against her husband’s rights, and that her husband has the right to set her straight and 
    discipline her. 
And Allaah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/258/psychological-and-social-problems,"What is the Islamic ruling in your view on a woman who reaches the age of sixty five, and from the time she married her husband at age 14 she has been suffering from her husband’s bad treatment, his beatings, his humiliating her in front of her children and in front of others, and always throwing her out of the house, yet despite that she has been patient and seeking reward from Allaah, responding to all his never-ending demands even though she suffers from heart disease and blood pressure, and the doctors have advised complete rest for her and that she should not exert herself? Recently this husband’s bad treatment of this woman has become even worse; he humiliated her in front of her guests, beat her and threw her out of the house, so she had no choice but to leave the house to him and go and stay with her children, knowing that he would not give her enough money. What is your view on this case? Now she does not want to go back to him and he does not want her and he does not acknowledge that he has wronged her… Is she guilty of anything if she does not go back to him if he asks her to?

      be to Allaah.

      It is haraam for the wife to ask for a divorce for no 
      reason, and it is haraam for her to go out of the house for no reason 
      without her husband’s permission. But if she is being harmed as a result 
      of staying in her husband’s house or staying married to him, then she has 
      the right to ask him for a divorce. She has the right to leave the house 
      and go to her family so that she can escape from her husband’s abuse and 
      beatings. The husband has to fear Allaah with regard to what Allaah has 
      put him in charge of. The Prophet urged good treatment of women, and 
      Allaah commanded His Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
      him) to treat people on a reasonable basis. Whatever the case, if the 
      husband’s abuse is ongoing then she has the right to ask for the marriage 
      to be annulled, and he has to respond to that request, or he has to repent 
      to Allaah, and stop harming her."

I ask Allah while washing my feet during wudu’ by the Prophet’s virtue to keep my feet firm on the Siraat.
Also during the prayer I ask Allah by his Prophet’s virtue to forgive my sins and to have mercy on me. Is this du’a permissible or not? 
I used to make du’a in this way believing that Allah will answer the prayer of who asks him by His beloved Prophet’s virtue, may peace  and blessings of Allah be upon him.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    Asking Allaah to make His slave’s feet steadfast on the 
    Straight Path is a good du’aa’ and there is nothing wrong with it. We ask 
    Allaah to make the feet of all of us steadfast.
    But there are two mistakes in this du’aa’:
    1 – Always reciting it when washing your feet during wudoo’:
    You know that wudoo’ is an act of worship and that the Muslim 
    does not have the right to change the way an act of worship is done or add 
    to it or take away from it; rather following the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) properly means doing what he did, without 
    adding or taking anything away.
    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (22/510):
    No one has the right to introduce to the people any kind of 
    dhikr or du’aa’ apart from those that are narrated in the Sunnah, and make 
    them a regular act of worship that the people do all the time, as they do 
    the five daily prayers; rather this is innovation in the religion for which 
    Allaah has not given permission. End quote.
    It was not the practice of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to say du’aa’ when washing the parts of the 
    body that are washed in wudoo’. There is a hadeeth concerning that, but it 
    is not a saheeh narration from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him).
    Al-Haafiz ibn al-Salaah said:
    There is no saheeh hadeeth concerning that. End quote. It was 
    mentioned thus by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees al-Habeer 
    (1/297).
    Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manaar al-Muneef (45):
    As for the mawdoo’ (fabricated) hadeeth about dhikr when 
    washing each part of the body (in wudoo’), it is baatil (invalid). End 
    quote.
    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said of the du’aa’s 
    recited when washing each part of the body (in wudoo’): The du’aa’ for 
    washing each part of the body (in wudoo’) has no basis.
    Al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah 
    (2/27-29).

     In Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (2/49):
    Some people think that there is a dhikr for every part of the 
    body (when doing wudoo’), and some ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning 
    that, but they are not saheeh at all, rather they are false. End quote.
    In Duroos li’l-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (no. 13, 
    tape 2) it says:
    There is no basis for any of this, and nothing has been 
    narrated in a sound report from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), so these du’aa’s are not recommended when washing these 
    parts of the body. Rather what is recommended (mustahabb) is two things: 
    Firstly, when starting to do wudoo’, one should mention the name of Allaah; 
    secondly, after finishing wudoo’ one should recite the Shahaadah. This is 
    what is prescribed with regard to wudoo’. End quote.
    It cannot be said that weak ahaadeeth should be acted upon 
    with regard to good deeds, because there is no consensus on this principle 
    and there are some who disagree with it. Moreover, with regard to acting 
    upon weak ahaadeeth, it is stipulated that they should not be severely weak, 
    and this condition is not met in this case, as was understood by Ibn ‘Allaan 
    in al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah (2/29).
    Al-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote an essay on 
    this matter entitled al-Ighda’ ‘an Du’aa’ al-A’daa’, in which he 
    explained how very weak the reports concerning that are, and that they are 
    not fit to be acted upon, even with regard to good deeds.
    See also the answer to question no. 
    45730.
    2 – As for the second mistake, it is your saying in your 
    du’aa’, “by the status of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him)”.
    Undoubtedly the status of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) is great, but Allaah has not made seeking 
    to draw near to Him (tawassul) by means of that one of the causes of du’aa’ 
    being answered.
    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) – who is the one who did not omit to guide us to anything that is good 
    – did not teach us to seek to draw near to Allaah by means of that.
    Hence it is known that this du’aa’ is not prescribed.
    This has already been explained in the answer to question no. 
    23265.

     So strive to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and do not add anything to it or take 
    anything away; keep away from things that have been introduced into the 
    religion, as the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    advised us when he said: “I urge you to adhere to 
    my Sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly guided Khulafa’ (al-Khulafa’ 
    al-Raashideen), and to seize it firmly. Beware of newly-innovated things, 
    for every innovation is a going-astray.” Narrated by Abu Dawood 
    (4607); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.

    This amount is small and need not be announced; it is not 
    worth the bother of announcing it. But if you give it to those who are in

    much as is possible for you, and say, “Who lost some money at the jamaraat?” 
    among groups of people, perhaps someone will come to you and describe it, 
    then you can give it to him if his description matches it, and there is 
    nothing wrong with that. If you give it in charity there is nothing wrong 
    with that either, because this is a small amount, so if you give it in charity on behalf of its owner there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allaah, and you will be rewarded. End quote."

    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in your efforts to fulfil 
    the duty of calling people to Allaah and in your keenness to spread good. 
    Your love of good and your efforts to spread it indicate that you are a good 
    person, in sha Allah. We ask Allaah that you will be included in His words 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real 
    followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever 
    raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al‑Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and 
    all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110]
Your saying that you love 
    Allaah is the characteristic of those whom Allaah loves, of whom He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “a people whom He will love and they will love Him”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:54]

    Whoever loves Allaah sincerely, Allaah will love him. The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet him.” (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 6507; Muslim, 2683).
    Al-Bukhaari (7375) and Muslim (813) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) sent a man on a campaign; when he led his companions 
    in prayer, he used to end his recitation with Qul Huwa Allaah Ahad. 
    When they came back, they mentioned that to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). He told them, ‘Ask him why he does that.” 
    He said, “Because it speaks of the Most Merciful and I love to recite it.” 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Tell him 
    that Allaah loves him.” This man loved the attributes of Allaah, so Allaah 
    loved him.
    If you want to know how sincere your love for Allaah is, then 
    examine yourself in the light of the following verse, in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Say (O Muhammad to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, 
    then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism,
    follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), 
    Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31]

    i.e., follow the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him).
    If Allaah loves you, you may receive the glad tidings of 
    great goodness. Allaah says in a hadeeth qudsi: “Whoever shows enmity to 
    someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My slave draws noy near 
    to Me with anything more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have 
    enjoined on him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with 
    supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his 
    hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with 
    which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask something 
    of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I 
    would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything so much as I 
    hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful slave: he hates death and I 
    hate hurting him.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6502).
    The following are six benefits that a person gains by loving 
    Allaah, in order of importance:
    1-Allah becomes his hearing, 
    i.e., he does not listen to anything except that which pleases Allaah.

    2-Allaah becomes his seeing, 
    i.e., he does not look at anything but that which pleases Allaah.

    3-Allaah becomes his foot with 
    which he walks, i.e., he does not walk for anything except that which is 
    pleasing to Allaah,

    4-Allaah becomes his hand with 
    which he strikes, i.e., he does not take revenge for himself but rather for 
    the sake of Allaah, so he does not do anything with his hand except that 
    which pleases Allaah.

    5-Allaah answers his du’aa’s

    6-Allaah grants him refuge from 
    everything that he dislikes.

    So congratulation to those whom Allaah loves, to the close 
    friends of Allaah, to the party of Allaah. 
    “They are the party of Allaah. Verily, it is the party of 
    Allaah that will be the successful” 

    [al-Mujaadilah 58:22]
With regard to 
    istikhaarah, it is prescribed when a person is thinking about doing 
    something, then he hesitates about it. But with regard the thing that you 
    are doing, namely calling people to Allaah, there is no need to pray 
    istikhaarah, rather you should go ahead and call people to Allaah with 
    wisdom and beautiful preaching.
    With regard to the bad dream that you saw, it is from the 
    Shaytaan. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    taught us, if we see something good in our dreams, to tell those whom we

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/3/basic-tenets-of-faith,"Is it true that all the kuffaar, even if their morals are good and they do not harm anyone, will enter Hell? If the answer is yes, then what about non-Muslim children and those who had no choice but to be born kaafirs?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    You should note that all the kaafirs who hear 
    the message of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and do not enter Islam will go to Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad) 
    from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikoon will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures”
[al-Bayyinah 98:6]
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies without having 
    believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” Narrated by Muslim, 153. 
The point is not whether their morals are 
    good, rather the point is whether they submit to Allaah and obey his commands. Do you not see the Magians [Zoroastrians] or the Buddhists, for 
    example, who worship fire or idols instead of Allaah, and they do not worship Allaah or submit to Him alone, and the Christians who say that God 
    has a son, and other mushriks (those who associate others with Allaah). They are being ill-mannered towards Allaah, and insulting and reviling 
    Him. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says, ‘The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And 
    he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the 
    initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: Allaah has taken to Himself a son, 
    while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4974. 
So how can their morals be good when they are 
    so ill-mannered towards Allaah, even though Allaah has given them hearing and sight, and has made everything easy for them, and has sent His 
    Messengers to them and revealed His Books to them, and bestowed His blessings upon them, so it is His right that they should thank Him and not be 
    ungrateful to Him or disbelieve in Him. If they do not do that then they deserve His punishment and wrath. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“and your Lord treats no one with 
    injustice”
[al-Kahf 18:49]
With regard to the situation of their children who die when still young, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez 
    ibn Baaz was asked about that and he said: 
If one who is not yet accountable dies among 
    kaafir parents, then he comes under the same rulings as them in this world, so he should not be washed and the funeral prayer should not be 
    offered for him, and he should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. 
But in the Hereafter his case is referred to 
    Allaah. It was narrated in a saheeh report that when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about the 
    children of the mushrikeen he said: “Allaah knows best what they would have done.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1384.  
Some of the scholars were of the view that 
    Allaah’s knowledge about them will be made manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be tested, as will the people who lived during 
    the fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others. If they do what they are told to do then they will enter Paradise, and if they disobey then 
    they will enter Hell. There are saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which say that the people who 
    lived during the fatrah (interval between two Prophets) will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. These are the people whom the call of the 
    Messengers did not reach and those who come under a similar ruling, such as the children of the mushrikeen, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“And We never punish until We have sent a 
    Messenger (to give warning)”
[al-Isra’ 17:15]
This is the most correct view among the various opinions 
    concerning the people who lived during the fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others whom the call did not reach, and it is the view 
    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim, and a number of the earlier and later generations.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/237/honouring-parents,"I am a young man, thirty years old. I wanted to get married to a girl whom I love and she is religiously-committed and of good character, but my mother and sisters objected to me marrying her for several reasons (including the fact that they wanted me to marry someone from a higher-class and wealthier family). I tried to convince them but I did not succeed. They threatened to cut me off if I went ahead and married her, but I did not pay attention to their threat. I went ahead and married her, and my family have carried out their threat and cut me off completely.

 Praise be to Allaah, I am happy with my wife but I feel very sad about my family’s attitude and their letting me down treatment at the time when I needed them to stand by my side. I have tried to reconcile with them after my marriage and I have asked some good people to mediate, but without success. Now after nearly a year I feel that we are very far apart and that the rift between us is even deeper. Am I committing sin in my attitude, and does my mother have the right to use her right that I should honour her as a means to force me to do what she wants and and take away my right to decide my future and to choose my life partner? May Allaah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    Our advice to parents and siblings is not to 
    prevent sons from getting married to whomever they want, if she is religiously-committed and of good character. 
They should strive to make their sons happy; 
    marrying a son to a woman he does not like puts him in a difficult situation: either he will divorce her or he will live with her even though he 
    does not like her and his heart is attached to another. This is harmful for him and for her, and exposes the family to disintegration. 
The parents do not have the right to force 
    their son to marry someone whom he does not like, and it is not permissible for them to cut him off if he goes against them in that. It is haraam 
    for a believer to forsake his fellow-believer unless there is a shar’i reason for doing so. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6065. The 
    sin is more serious if the forsaking for no reason involves a son, mother, brother or other relative, because in that case he is combining two 
    sins: forsaking a Muslim and severing the ties of kinship. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 
The parents have no right to force their son 
    to marry someone he does not want. If he refuses he is not being disobedient; it is like forcing him to eat something he does not want. 
    al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 344 
Based on this, what you did was not a sin, but you have to continue to honour your mother and 
    uphold the ties of kinship with your sisters as much as you can. Try to reconcile with them. Go to your mother, kiss her head and hand, for she 
    only wants you to be happy. Tell her that you are happy and ask her for her approval. 
Do the same with your sisters. 
If they continue to cut you off, then ask 
    Allaah’s help and continue to honour them and uphold the ties of kinship with them. Remember the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him): “The upholder of kinship ties is not the one who is kind to them if they are kind to him, rather the upholder of kinship ties 
    is the one who, if his relatives cut him off, he upholds the ties of kinship with them.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5991. 
We ask Allaah to set your affairs straight and those of all the Muslims. 
And Allaah knows best."

You can start fasting six days of Shawwaal from the second day of Shawwaal, because it is haraam to fast on the day of Eid. You can fast the six days at any time during Shawwaal, although the best of good deeds are those which are done soonest.
The standing committee received the following question:
Should fasting the six days be done immediately after Ramadaan, following the day of Eid or is it permissible to do it a few days after Eid in the month of Shawwaal or not?
They replied as follows:
These days do not have to be fasted immediately after Eid al-Fitr; it is permissible to start fasting them one or more days after Eid, and they may be done consecutively or separately during the month of Shawwaal, according to what is easier for a person. There is plenty of room for maneuver in this matter, and this is not obligatory, it is Sunnah.
And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions and grant them peace."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/48/divorce,"My wife believes that I divorced her, but in reality I did not. In anger, I sent her a text saying Wallahi you are on your last divorce, but I had the intention of scaring her, not divorcing her. Then I sent another text saying 'I divorce you', with the same intention of scaring her. She refuses to come back to me because she thinks she is irrevocably divorced. I try to explain to her that a written divorce does not count unless the man had the intention of divorce, which I did not. She does not believe me. She claims that I had the intention of divorce and calls me a liar.

Is a woman obliged to believe the husband that he did not have the intention of divorce? Or is it permissible for her to argue that he did have the intention - and not return to him?

She insists on going to people of knowledge to seek the ruling on the validity of the divorce without me. When a scholar gives her the general advice that 'if he divorced you three times then you become haraam for him' - she says this is sufficient for her and stays away from me. I tell her we must both go together to a person of knowledge, so he can study what happened between us in detail, and give a ruling based on both our arguments. She refuses and says she is happy with what the scholar told her. Is this permissible for her to look for a ruling like this?

Now she is talking to another brother. If she gets married to him in this state, without me giving her a legitimate divorce, is her new marriage valid?","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:

	If the matter is as you describe, that you wrote these 
	messages to your wife without intending that divorce should happen – rather 
	it was with the intention of threatening or scaring her – then no divorce 
	has taken place, as has been explained previously in fatwa no. 
	72291.

	Secondly:

	If a woman claims that her husband has divorced her, and the 
	husband denies it, then what counts is his word, unless the wife can produce 
	proof, which is two witnesses of sound character, as has been explained in 
	detail, with mention of the scholars’ views, in fatwa no. 
	175181.

	Thus it is known that your wife is still married to you, and 
	is not divorced from you, based on what you have mentioned.

	So what she must do is fear Allah, may He be exalted, and 
	comply with the rulings of sharia, which indicate that what counts with 
	regard to whether there was an intention that divorce should happen or not 
	is the word of the husband, as we have explained above.

	If the wife is uncertain about her situation, or she is 
	uncertain as to what her husband says about any of the details of what 
	happened, or she herself is not content with what you say concerning this 
	issue, then undoubtedly the only proper thing to do in such situations is 
	for you and her to go to a scholar whose knowledge and trustworthiness you 
	both accept, and tell him what happened between you, and accept his verdict 
	and fatwa concerning your case.

	This woman should understand that if she marries somebody 
	else in this situation, then she will be committing an immoral deed, because 
	she is still married to her first husband and has not become separated from 
	him.

	In that case, the fatwa of the person whom she asked will be 
	of no benefit, even if he is a scholar, because he gave an answer concerning 
	an abstract issue, without hearing both sides of the story."

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/21/alliance-and-amity-disavowal-and-enmity,"I was having a discussion with my brother about loving the people of the Book, and I said to him that this is not permissible, and it is not permissible to take them as friends or to congratulate them on their festivals, or even initiate greetings with them, and other kinds of love. But he argued back by saying that Allah has permitted us to marry their women, and Allah has created love and compassion between spouses.
I hope that you can give us a detailed answer that will reconcile between the belief in al-wala’ wa’l-bara’ (love and friendship towards believers versus disavowal of disbelievers), and the notion of love for a wife from the people of the Book (i.e. a Jewish or Christian woman). What are the conditions stipulated in sharee‘ah for marriage to a Jewish or Christian woman?","Praise be to Allah.
Firstly:
We have previously explained the conditions that must be met by a Jewish or Christian woman in order for it to be permissible to marry her. Please see the answers to questions no. 95572 and 2527. 
Secondly: 
Generally speaking, love is of two types: spiritual love (that is based on ties of faith) and natural love (that is based on human inclinations and feelings). With regard to spiritual love, some types are obligatory and some are prohibited, and some types constitute shirk (association of others with Allah) – you may find a detailed discussion of that in the answer to question no. 276. 
With regard to natural love, this is that which is naturally inherent in man, such as love of cold drinks or love of wealth. That also includes love for parents, children and relatives. There is no reward for it in principle, but a person may be sinning if he goes to extremes in his love for these things at the expense of his religious commitment and going against the laws of his Lord, such as if he becomes a slave to money, or he gives precedence to obeying his father over obeying his Lord, and so on. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is proven in as-Saheeh that the Prophet said: “No one of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child and his father and all the people.” This hadith mentions three kinds of love, for love is either based on respect and veneration, such as love for one’s father; or it is based on compassion, affection and kindness, such as love for one’s child; or it is love that is motivated by kindness and aspirations of attaining perfection, such as love of people for one another. No person truly believes until his love for the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is greater than all these kinds of love.
End quote from Jala’ al-Afhaam (1/391, 392) 
Part of natural love is that which exists between spouses, which dispels the confusion mentioned in the brother’s question. The existence of natural love between the spouses does not mean that one should overlook spiritual love that is based on religious ties. Therefore it is possible to dislike her in one way because she is following the wrong religion whilst loving her because she is one’s wife. It is possible to differentiate between these two matters, for a person is naturally inclined to have love for fathers, mothers, children and wives, yet at the same time it is not allowed to love the disbelievers who are hostile towards Islam, no matter how close they may be to one. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“You (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And We will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein (forever). Allah is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allah. Verily, it is the Party of Allah that will be the successful”
[al-Mujaadilah 58:22]. 
One of the major principles of Islam is that no soul is burdened with more than it can bear. Hence it is possible to differentiate between the two types of love, that which occurs naturally and that which is prescribed in Islam; this is within a person’s capability. 
Allah, may He be exalted, has told us of how Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) and the believers who were with him resented their people who were disbelievers, even though among them were their families and relatives, and there was natural love among them. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allah Alone’”
[al-Mumtahinah 60:4]. 
Allah, may He be exalted, approved of the love of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for his paternal uncle Abu Taalib, despite the fact that he was a disbeliever, because that was natural love that was based on ties of kinship. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: 
Allah revealed concerning Abu Taalib the words (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily! You (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) guide not whom you love” [al-Qasas 28:56]. That is, you do not have the power to guide whomever you love among your relatives or your paternal uncle. What is meant by love here is natural love, not spiritual love, for it is not permissible to have spiritual love for a mushrik even if he is the closest of people to you. “You (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people)” [al-Mujaadilah 58:22]. So spiritual love is not permissible in this case; as for natural love, that does not have anything to do with religious matters.
I‘aanah al-Mustafeed bi Sharh Kitaab at-Tawheed (1/356) 
All of that was summed up by Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him) in a wise answer concerning this issue. He said: 
There are two types of love: natural love, such as a man’s love for his wife, his child and his wealth; this is the type mentioned in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect” [ar-Room 30:21]. (The other type is) spiritual love, such as love for Allah and His Messenger, and love for that which Allah and His Messenger love of deeds, words and people. 
Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “…Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him…” [al-Maa’idah 5:54]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the believers in their mutual love, compassion and affection is that of the body…” 
There is not necessarily a connection between the two types of love, in the sense that natural love may exist alongside spiritual resentment, such as love for parents who are mushrikeen. One may resent them for the sake of Allah, but this is not contrary to love for them which is natural, because humans are created with the inclination to love their parents and relatives, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) loved his paternal uncle because he was a close relative, despite the fact that he was a disbeliever. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily! You (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) guide not whom you love” [al-Qasas 28:56]. 
Another example of this type of love is: love for a wife who is one of the People of the Book. It is obligatory to resent her in a spiritual sense because of her disbelief, but that does not rule out loving her in the sense of that love which exists between a man and his wife. So she is beloved in one way and resented in another. This is something that occurs frequently. Natural dislike or resentment may be combined with spiritual love, as in the case of jihad: it may be disliked naturally, but loved because Allah enjoins it and because of the positive consequences that result from it in this world and the hereafter. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Jihad (fighting in Allah’s Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know” [al-Baqarah 2:216]. 
Another example of this type is the Muslim’s love for his fellow Muslim who has wronged him; he loves him for the sake of Allah but he resents him because of his mistreatment of him. In fact both natural love and natural resentment may coexist, as in the case of bitter medicine: the patient hates it because it is bitter but he takes it because of the benefits he hopes to gain from it. 
Similarly, spiritual love may coexist with spiritual resentment, as in the case of the Muslim who is an evildoer; he is loved for the sake of what he has of faith, but he is resented for the sin that he commits. 
The wise man is the one who regulates his love and resentment in accordance with Islamic teachings and reason, far removed from whims and desires. And Allah knows best.

I ask Allah while washing my feet during wudu’ by the Prophet’s virtue to keep my feet firm on the Siraat.
Also during the prayer I ask Allah by his Prophet’s virtue to forgive my sins and to have mercy on me. Is this du’a permissible or not? 
I used to make du’a in this way believing that Allah will answer the prayer of who asks him by His beloved Prophet’s virtue, may peace  and blessings of Allah be upon him.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    Asking Allaah to make His slave’s feet steadfast on the 
    Straight Path is a good du’aa’ and there is nothing wrong with it. We ask 
    Allaah to make the feet of all of us steadfast.
    But there are two mistakes in this du’aa’:
    1 – Always reciting it when washing your feet during wudoo’:
    You know that wudoo’ is an act of worship and that the Muslim 
    does not have the right to change the way an act of worship is done or add 
    to it or take away from it; rather following the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) properly means doing what he did, without 
    adding or taking anything away.
    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (22/510):
    No one has the right to introduce to the people any kind of 
    dhikr or du’aa’ apart from those that are narrated in the Sunnah, and make 
    them a regular act of worship that the people do all the time, as they do 
    the five daily prayers; rather this is innovation in the religion for which 
    Allaah has not given permission. End quote.
    It was not the practice of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to say du’aa’ when washing the parts of the 
    body that are washed in wudoo’. There is a hadeeth concerning that, but it 
    is not a saheeh narration from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him).
    Al-Haafiz ibn al-Salaah said:
    There is no saheeh hadeeth concerning that. End quote. It was 
    mentioned thus by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees al-Habeer 
    (1/297).
    Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manaar al-Muneef (45):
    As for the mawdoo’ (fabricated) hadeeth about dhikr when 
    washing each part of the body (in wudoo’), it is baatil (invalid). End 
    quote.
    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said of the du’aa’s 
    recited when washing each part of the body (in wudoo’): The du’aa’ for 
    washing each part of the body (in wudoo’) has no basis.
    Al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah 
    (2/27-29).

     In Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (2/49):
    Some people think that there is a dhikr for every part of the 
    body (when doing wudoo’), and some ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning 
    that, but they are not saheeh at all, rather they are false. End quote.
    In Duroos li’l-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (no. 13, 
    tape 2) it says:
    There is no basis for any of this, and nothing has been 
    narrated in a sound report from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), so these du’aa’s are not recommended when washing these 
    parts of the body. Rather what is recommended (mustahabb) is two things: 
    Firstly, when starting to do wudoo’, one should mention the name of Allaah; 
    secondly, after finishing wudoo’ one should recite the Shahaadah. This is 
    what is prescribed with regard to wudoo’. End quote.
    It cannot be said that weak ahaadeeth should be acted upon 
    with regard to good deeds, because there is no consensus on this principle 
    and there are some who disagree with it. Moreover, with regard to acting 
    upon weak ahaadeeth, it is stipulated that they should not be severely weak, 
    and this condition is not met in this case, as was understood by Ibn ‘Allaan 
    in al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah (2/29).
    Al-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote an essay on 
    this matter entitled al-Ighda’ ‘an Du’aa’ al-A’daa’, in which he 
    explained how very weak the reports concerning that are, and that they are 
    not fit to be acted upon, even with regard to good deeds.
    See also the answer to question no. 
    45730.
    2 – As for the second mistake, it is your saying in your 
    du’aa’, “by the status of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him)”.
    Undoubtedly the status of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) is great, but Allaah has not made seeking 
    to draw near to Him (tawassul) by means of that one of the causes of du’aa’ 
    being answered.
    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) – who is the one who did not omit to guide us to anything that is good 
    – did not teach us to seek to draw near to Allaah by means of that.
    Hence it is known that this du’aa’ is not prescribed.
    This has already been explained in the answer to question no.

     So strive to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and do not add anything to it or take 
    anything away; keep away from things that have been introduced into the 
    religion, as the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    advised us when he said: “I urge you to adhere to 
    my Sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly guided Khulafa’ (al-Khulafa’ 
    al-Raashideen), and to seize it firmly. Beware of newly-innovated things, 
    for every innovation is a going-astray.” Narrated by Abu Dawood

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/18/names-and-attributes-of-allaah,What is the difference between the names and attributes of Allaah?,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    The names of Allaah are 
    all those names that refer to Allaah Himself and also refer to one of His 
    perfect attributes that exist in Him, such as al-Qaadir (the All-Powerful), 
    al-‘Aleem (the All-Knowing), al-Hakeem (the Most Wise), al-Samee’ (the 
    All-Hearing), al-Baseer (the All-Seeing). These names refer to Allaah 
    Himself and to His qualities of knowledge, wisdom, hearing, sight. So the 
    names refer to two things, while attributes refer to one thing. And it was 
    said that the name includes the attribute and the attribute implies the 
    name. We must believe in all the attributes that have been narrated from 
    Allaah or from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    in a manner that befits Allaah, whilst also believing that He does not 
    resemble any of His creation in any of His attributes, just as He does not 
    resemble them in His Essence. Allaah says: 
“Say (O Muhammad): He 
    is Allaah, (the) One. 
Allaah-us-Samad 
    [Allaah — the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither 
    eats nor drinks)].
He begets not, nor was 
    He begotten.
And there is none 
    co-equal or comparable unto Him.””
[al-Ikhlaas] 
“There is nothing like 
    Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer”
[al-Shoora 42:11]

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah bless our 
    Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."

      be to Allah.

      One of the proven reports from the Prophet (blessings and 
      peace of Allah be upon him) states that whoever drinks from his Cistern on 
      the Day of Resurrection will never thirst again after that.  It was 
      narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The 
      Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “My cistern is 
      the size of a month’s journey, its water is whiter than milk, its 
      fragrance is better than musk, and its jugs are like the stars of the sky. 
      Whoever drinks from it will never thirst again.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6579) and Muslim (2292).
    It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa‘d (may Allah be pleased with 
    him) said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    say: “I will reach the Cistern ahead of you. Whoever comes to it will drink 
    from it, and whoever drinks from it will never thirst again after that…”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7051) and Muslim (2291)
    These hadiths clearly state that whoever drinks from the 
    cistern of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), male or 
    female, will never thirst again after that.
    Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The 
    apparent meaning of the hadith of the cistern indicates that his entire 
    ummah will drink from it, except those who turn back on their heels, change 
    (the religion) and introduce (innovations).

    End quote from Ikmaal al-Mu‘allim Sharh Saheeh Muslim 
    (7/130)
    The apparent meaning of these hadiths indicates that the 
    drinking will be directly from the cistern or from the jugs that are near to 
    it, and that the people will drink from it themselves.
    We have not seen in any version of the hadith anything to 
    suggest that they will drink from the hand of the Prophet (blessings and 
    peace of Allah be upon him).
    If people were to drink at the cistern from the hand of the 
    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he would have told us of 
    that.
    Therefore, with regard to a Muslim – male or female –praying 
    that Allah will give him to drink from the hand of the Messenger (blessings 
    and peace of Allah be upon him) an enjoyable drink after which they will 
    never thirst again, there is the fear that this may come under the heading 
    of overstepping the mark in supplication and asking Allah for something of 
    which we have no knowledge.
    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Any request 
    that is contrary to the wisdom of Allah, or implies going against His laws 
    and commands, or implies going against what He has told us, comes under the 
    heading of overstepping the mark, which Allah does not love and He does not 
    love the one who makes such a request.

    End quote from Badaa’i‘ al-Fawaa’id (3/524)
    What is prescribed is for the Muslim to ask Allah to cause 
    him to drink from the cistern of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him), a drink after which he will never thirst again. So he should 
    limit his request in his supplication to that which is mentioned in the 
    saheeh texts. And Allah knows best.
    Moreover, for women to drink from the hand of the Messenger 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not something prohibited, 
    because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is like a 
    father to all the believers (both men and women). Therefore one of his 
    unique characteristics (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was that 
    it was not haraam for him to touch a woman who was not his mahram, or to be 
    alone with her.
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    What is clear to us, on the basis of strong evidence, is that 
    one of the unique characteristics of the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him) is that it was permissible for him to be alone with a 
    non-mahram woman and to look at her. This is the correct answer regarding 
    the story of Umm Haraam bint Milhaan, and his entering upon her, sleeping in 
    her house, and her combing his hair, even though there was no relationship 
    through ties of blood or marriage between them.

      be to Allah.
    
    Firstly:
    Compulsive waswaas refers to thoughts and bad ideas that come 
    one after another to a person’s mind even though he does not want them, in 
    such a way that he cannot rid himself of them, even though he knows and is 
    certain that they are foolish and unacceptable thoughts. They keep coming to 
    his mind compulsively, which causes him a great deal of anguish and 
    distress.
    The remedy for compulsive waswaas and other types of waswaas 
    is to remember Allah a great deal, obey Him, and turn to Him, beseeching 
    Him, and seeking refuge with Him; to overlook and ignore the waswaas, and 
    not let oneself get carried away with it. In some cases there is a need to 
    consult a doctor.

    90819.

    Allah will not punish a person or call him to account for 
    this waswaas, because it is beyond his control and overwhelms him; it does 
    not happen by his choice. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):

    “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]

    “Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has 
    given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.”

    [al-Talaaq 65:7]

     “So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you 
    can”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:16].
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of 
    Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: 
    “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will forgive my ummah for whatever 
    crosses their minds so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6664; Muslim, 
    127.
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have 
    mercy on him) said:

    Allah will not punish the one who suffers from compulsive 
    waswaas, because He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “our 
    Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear” 
    [al-Baqarah 2:286] 
    and “Allah burdens not a person beyond his 
    scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286]. But the one who is 
    suffering from waswaas has to frequently seek refuge with Allah from the 
    accursed Shaytaan and ignore it; if he does that, then it will depart from 
    him by Allah’s leave. End quote.
    Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 24/2
    If this man speaks words of kufr (disbelief) and words that 
    put him beyond the pale of Islam because of this compulsive waswaas, without 
    being aware of what he is saying or understanding what it means, or he 
    understands what it means but he did not intend to say it and did not say it 
    voluntarily – rather he said it under the pressure of this waswaas which 
    forced him to say it – then he will not be punished for it, because it is 
    beyond his control. He comes under the same ruling as one who speaks words 
    of kufr because he is forced to do so. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Whoever 
    disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and 
    whose heart is at rest with Faith but such as open their hearts to 
    disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a great torment”

    [an-Nahl 16:106].
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

    If he is forced to disbelieve and he disbelieves, but his 
    heart is at rest with Faith, then he is not deemed to be a disbeliever, 
    because there is an impediment to doing so, which is that he was forced. End

    It is not permissible to describe as a disbeliever one who 
    was forced to utter words of disbelief when his heart was at rest with 
    Faith. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “…except him who is forced 
    thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith …” [an-Nahl 16:106].

    Based on that, this man is not to be deemed an apostate, 
    unless he says or does something to indicate disbelief at the time when he 
    is aware of what he is doing, and he says or does it voluntarily. In that 
    case he would be deemed an apostate and would bear full responsibility for 
    his words or deeds.
    Secondly:
    The family’s role towards this poor father may be summed up 
    as follows:
    1.All the members of the family 
    have to show patience towards him with regard to unpleasant things that 
    happen with him, because that is happening without him intending it to.

    2.They should strive to find 
    treatment for him and spend as much as they can on that, and use tricks to 
    treat him. Many cases of waswaas are in fact cases of sickness that can be 
    treated by psychologists and the like.

    3.They should offer a lot of 
    supplication and beseech Allah to remove this harm and heal him.

    4.Ruqya as prescribed in Islam. 
    His son, wife or any other family member or other person may perform ruqya 
    for him as prescribed in Islam. Allah may heal types of chronic sickness by 
    His grace, by means of Islamically prescribed ruqya from the Qur’an and 
    Sunnah.

    Thirdly:
    If this suitor is of good character and religiously 
    committed, then there is nothing wrong with marrying him, whether his father 
    is healthy or otherwise, and whether he is a Muslim or an apostate. None of 
    those factors are an impediment to marrying his son, so long as the son is 
    religiously committed and of good character.
    However we do not think that you should rush to accept such a 
    person; rather proceeding with caution in the case of such proposals that 
    may lead to complicated social problems is better, more sensible and wiser.
    You have to let your guardians know about the matter and they 
    should find out the facts for themselves, so that they can make the right 
    decision for their daughter.
    If you feel that this will have an impact on your life and 
    your social relationships, then you are still young, so if you wait for a 
    more suitable opportunity that is less likely to cause you problems, then 
    perhaps that is better and more appropriate.
    If you insist on accepting this suitor, and your guardians 
    agree to it, then you and your husband should have separate accommodation; 
    that is more likely to avoid problems and keep you away from troubles.
    Moreover, he will be the grandfather of your children and 
    also your father-in-law, the father of your husband, so you should strive 
    hard to treat him kindly as much as you can.

Is that permissible? Please note that delaying it until after Ramadan will result in missing out on the surgery because the surgeon will be travelling, and because of my work circumstances.","Praise be to Allah 
If delaying the surgery until after Ramadan will exacerbate the sickness, or delay recovery, resulting in hardship and trouble, or the delay will result in problems, such as if the alternative appointment is relatively far off, or will cause you to miss out on having the surgery performed by a skilled doctor, then there is nothing wrong with doing it in Ramadan, even if the surgery causes the patient to break the fast.
But if it is possible to delay it until after Ramadan without causing any hardship or difficulty, then it is not permissible for the patient to break the fast because of that, because the fast of Ramadan is obligatory, and cannot be omitted because of something that it is possible to delay.

And what about his relatives and offspring?
What about the genereations before and after him.","Praise be to Allaah.
Firstly:
 Memorizing the Qur’aan is an act of worship through which one seeks the Face of Allaah and reward in the Hereafter. Without this intention, he will never have any reward, rather he will be punished for doing this act of worship for someone or something other than Allaah. 
The haafiz (the person who has memorized the Qur’aan) should not have any intention of gaining worldly benefits by memorizing the Qur’aan, because his memorization thereof is not a product to be traded with in this world, rather it is an act of worship which is done for the sake of his Lord.
 Allaah has given special privileges to the one who memorizes the Qur’aan in a number of ways in this world and in the Hereafter, for example:
 1 – He takes precedence over others in leading the prayer.
 It was narrated that Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The people should be led in prayer by the one among them who has the most knowledge of the Book of Allaah; if they are equal in knowledge of the Qur’aan, then by the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah; if they are equal in knowledge of the Sunnah, then by the one who migrated (made hijrah) first; if they are equal in terms of hijrah, then by the one who became Muslim first. No man should lead another in prayer in his domain of authority, or sit in his place in his house, except with his permission.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 673) 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: “When the first muhaajiroon (emigrants) came to Quba’, before the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came (to Madeenah), Saalim the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah used to lead them in prayer, and he was the one who knew the most Qur’aan.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 660)
2 – He is placed in front of others in a common grave, closer to the qiblah, if it is essential to bury him with others.
 It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The Prophet would wrap two of the men slain at Uhud in a single cloth, then he would ask, ‘Which of them knew more Qur’aan?’ If one of them was pointed out to him, he would put that one in the lahd (niche in the side of the grave) first. And he said, ‘I will be a witness over these people on the Day of Resurrection.’ He commanded that they should be buried with their blood, without being washed, and that no funeral prayer should be offered for them.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1278)
 3 – He takes precedence in leadership if he able to bear that
 It was narrated from ‘Aamir ibn Waathilah that Naafi’ ibn ‘Abd al-Haarith met ‘Umar in ‘Usfaan, and ‘Umar had appointed him as governor of Makkah. ‘Umar said, “Who have you appointed in charge of the people of the valley?” He said, “Ibn Abza.” ‘Umar asked, “Who is Ibn Abza?” He said, “One of our freed slaves.” Umar said, “Have you appointed over them a freed slave?!” He said, “He is well-versed in the Book of Allaah and he has knowledge of the laws of inheritance.” ‘Umar said: “Your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Indeed, by this Book, Allaah would exalt some people and degrade others.’”
(Narrated by Muslim, 817)
 With regard to the Hereafter:
 4 – The status of the one who memorizes Qur’aan will be commensurate with the last aayah he memorized. 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Qur’aan (i.e., the one who memorized and studied it): ‘Read, advance in status and recite as you used to do in the world, for your status will be commensurate with the last aayah that you recite.’”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2914; he said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 2329, it is hasan saheeh. Also narrated by Abu Dawood, 1464).
 What is meant by reciting here is memorizing.
 5 – He will be with the angels, accompanying them. 
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who recites the Qur’aan and learns it by heart, will be with the noble righteous scribes (in Heaven) and the one who exerts himself to learn the Qur’aan by heart and recites it with great difficulty, will have a double reward.”
 (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4653; Muslim, 798) 
6 – He will be given a crown of honour and a garment of honour to wear. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Qur’aan will come on the Day of Resurrection and will say, ‘O Lord, adorn him.’ So he will be given a crown of honour to wear. Then it will say, ‘O Lord, give him more.’ So he will be given a garment of honour.’ Then it will say, ‘O Lord, be pleased with him.’ So Allaah will be pleased with him. Then it will be said to him, ‘Recite and advance in status, and for each verse you will gain one more hasanah (reward for good deed).”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2915. He said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2328, this is hasan).
 7 – The Qur’aan will intercede for him with his Lord. 
It was narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Recite the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection to intercede for its companions. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal ‘Imraan, for they will come on the Day of Resurrection like two clouds or two shades or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat al-Baqarah for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.”
 (Narrated by Muslim, 804, and by al-Bukhaari in a mu’allaq report). 
Secondly:
With regard to his relatives and descendents, there is evidence concerning his parents that they will be clothed with garments which far surpass everything to be found in this world, and that will only be because they took care of and taught their child. Even if they themselves were ignorant, Allaah will honour them because of their child. But the one who prevented his child from learning the Qur’aan, he will be one of those who are deprived. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The Qur’aan will come on the Day of Resurrection like a pale man saying to its companion, “Do you recognize me? I am the one who made you stay up at night and made you thirsty during the day…” Then he will be given dominion in his right hand and eternity in his left, and a crown of dignity will be placed upon his head, and his parents will be clothed with garments which far surpass everything to be found in this world. They will say, “O Lord, how did we earn this.” It will be said to them, “Because you taught your child the Qur’aan.”’”
(Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, 6/51). 
It was narrated that Buraydah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever reads the Qur’aan, learns it and acts in accordance with it, on the Day of Resurrection his parents will be given a crown to wear whose light will be like the light of the sun, and his parents will be given garments which far surpass everything to be found in this world. They will say, “Why have we been given this to wear?” It will be said, “Because your child learned the Qur’aan.”’”

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/19/shirk-and-its-different-forms,"In the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid al-Laythi (may Allaah be pleased with him) it says: “We went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Hunayn and we were new in Islam. The mushrikeen had a tree to which they would go and spend time (to seek blessings) and they used to hang their weapons on it, it was called Dhat Anwaat…” What is the meaning of the word Anwaat?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    This hadeeth 
    was narrated by Imam Ahmad (2139) and by al-Tirmidhi (2180), who said it is 
    hasan saheeh. It was also narrated by Ibn Abi Aasim in al-Sunnah. 
    Al-Manaawi said: its isnaad is saheeh. And it was classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Riyaadh al-Sunnah, no. 76. 
These words were 
    narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid al-Laythi (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him): They went out from Makkah with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Hunayn. The kuffaar had a tree to which 
    they would go and spend time (to seek blessings) and they used to hang their 
    weapons on it, and it was called Dhaat Anwaat. We passed by a large green 
    tree and we said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, make for us a dhaat anwaat.’ The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you have said the same as the people 
    of Moosa said: make for us a god as they have gods. Verily you are a people 
    who know not. These are ways that you will certainly follow as did those who 
    came before you, step by step.’ 
According to 
    a report narrated by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim in Kitaab al-Sunnah: And we were 
    new in Islam (at that time). 
With regard 
    to the words Dhaat Anwaat: Anwaat is the plural of the word nawt, 
    which refers to anything that is hung up. Dhaat Anwaat is the tree on which 
    these things were hung. Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah: This is 
    the name of a specific tree that belonged to the mushrikeen, on which they 
    used to hang their weapons and to which they would go and spend time (to 
    seek blessings). They asked him to make something like that for them, and he 
    forbade them to do that. 
With regard 
    to the phrase, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you have said the same 
    as the people of Moosa said: make for us a god as they have gods. Verily you 
    are a people who know not”: Here the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) likened what they had said to the words of the Children 
    of Israel when they passed by some people who were worshipping their idols. 
    They asked Moosa (peace be upon him) to make for them a god that they could 
    worship as those people had a god. 
With regard 
    to the phrase “These are ways that you will certainly follow as did those 
    who came before you”: i.e., this is the way of the nations who came before 
    you. What is meant here is the way of the people who follow whims and 
    desires and innovations that they introduced based on their own ideas after 
    their Prophets were gone, and they changed their religion.  
According to 
    the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed that was narrated by al-Bukhaari: “You will follow 
    the ways of those who came before you, handspan by handspan, cubit by cubit, 
    until even if they entered the hole of a lizard you will follow them.” We 
    said: “O Messenger of Allaah, (do you mean) the Jews and the Christians?” He 
    said: “Who else?” 
Al-Nawawi 
    said: This is a manifest miracle of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), for what he foretold indeed came to pass. 
From this 
    hadeeth we learn the following:
    1-To beware of shirk (associating 
    others with Allaah) and that a person may think that something is good and 
    will bring him closer to Allaah, when it is as far removed as it can be from 
    the mercy of his Lord and will bring him closer to His wrath.

    2-Seeking blessings from trees 
    and rocks and being attached to them are all acts of shirk which have 
    happened in this ummah. Whoever falls into these things is following the 
    path of the Jews and Christians and forsaking the path of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

    3-What counts is meanings, not 
    words. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened 
    what they said to what the Children of Israel said, even though they were 
    not blatantly asking for a god instead of Allaah.

    4-It is forbidden to imitate the 
    people of the Jaahiliyyah and the people of the Book in things that are 
    unique to them and in their acts of worship.

    5-It shows that when a person has 
    moved away from falsehood to which he was accustomed, there is no guarantee 
    that something of those old traditions will not be left in his heart, 
    because the Sahaabah who asked him for that had only been Muslims for a few 
    days, as they became Muslim on the day of the conquest of Makkah, then the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took them out on 
    the campaign of Hunayn. This incident took place on the way to Hunayn.
See Fath 
    al-Majeed bi Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, 139-147; and al-Qawl al-Mufeed 
    by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. 
We would 
    remind the questioner that Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) quoted this hadeeth in his blessed book Kitaab 
    al-Tawheed, in the chapter on Seeking blessings from trees, rocks, 
    etc. We advise him to read this, along with the commentary, especially 
    the two commentaries referred to above, as he will learn a great deal from 
    it. And Allaah is the Source of strength."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/115/things-which-invalidate-the-fast,"I was wondering when I read in the quran in sura albaqara in verse 187 that allah say "" and continue your fasting until the night "" and most of us break our fast and the mughrib time . could u explian this situation forme please.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    There is no contradiction between this aayah and the fact 
    that the fast is broken after the sun sets, because night begins when the 
    sun sets. The beginning of the night is sunset, and the end of the night is 
    when dawn comes. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “When night comes, and day ends, and the sun has set, then 
    let the fasting person break his fast.” What the hadeeth means is that when 
    the sun has set, night has begun and day has ended, and at that time it 
    becomes permissible for the fasting person to break his fast. See Sharh 
    Muslim by al-Nawawi (7/209).
    And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/234/etiquette-of-dreams,"Often I remember death and I feel very afraid, I dream that I have died, and I wake up very scared. May Allaah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    Fear of death is a feeling that affects most people. Allaah 
    has created man in such a way that he loves life and fears the unknown, and 
    He has made death part of the world of the unseen which cannot be fully 
    understood except by the one who enters it. When a person thinks of it, he 
    cannot help but feel feelings of loneliness and fear or anxiety about that 
    unknown future.
    This is the natural explanation for man's fear of death in 
    general.
    But the believer who submits to the will and decree of 
    Allaah, and in whose heart love of Allaah is instilled and who thinks 
    positively of Allaah realises that by his death he is returning to a 
    generous Lord and a merciful God, Who will reward him for good deeds with 
    good things and Who will pardon his bad deeds by His mercy and forgiveness. 
    That is only for the believer who puts his trust in Allaah and whose heart 
    is humble before Him, the Accepter of repentance. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “No doubt! Verily, the Awliya’ [close friends] of Allaah, 
    no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. 63. Those who 
    believed, and used to fear Allaah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and 
    sins and by doing righteous deeds). 64. For them are glad tidings, in 
    the life of the present world, and in the Hereafter. No change can there be 
    in the Words of Allaah. This is indeed the supreme success”

    [Yoonus 10:62-64]

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
    

    Here Allaah is telling us that His close friends are those 
    who believe and are pious, as their Lord describes them. So everyone who is 
    pious is a friend of Allaah. “No fear shall come upon them” means 
    with regard to what they encounter of the terrors of the resurrection. “Nor 
    shall they grieve” means for what they have left behind them in this 
    world. End quote.
    Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem, 
    4/278
    This is how you should be.
    We should all strive to be friends of Allaah, so that we may 
    obtain His love and pleasure, and so that His love will be the most 
    beautiful thing in our hearts. Then death will become no more than moving to 
    be under the care of the Most Generous, Most Merciful, may He be glorified, 
    and liberation from the limitations and bonds of this world to the expanse 
    and pleasures of the Hereafter.
    It was narrated from Abu Qataadah ibn Rib’i that he used to 
    narrate that a funeral passed by the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and 
    peace of Allaah be upon him) and he said: “One who has found relief and one 
    from whom relief has been found.” They said: O Messenger of Allaah, who are 
    the one who has found relief and the one from whom relief has been found? He 
    said: “The believing person has found relief from the troubles of this 
    world, and the people, the land, the trees and the animals have found relief 
    from the evil person.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6512) and Muslim (950).
    It was narrated from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit that the Prophet 
    of Allaah said: “Whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet him, and 
    whoever hates to meet Allaah, Allaah hates to meet him.”

    ‘Aa’ishah or one of his wives said: We hate death. He said: 
    “It is not like that. When the believer is dying, he is given the glad 
    tidings of the pleasure and honour of Allaah, and nothing is dearer to him 
    than that which is ahead of him, and he loves to meet Allaah and Allaah 
    loves to meet him. But when the disbeliever is dying, he is given tidings of 
    the punishment and wrath of Allaah, and nothing is more hated to him than 
    what is ahead of him, and he hates to meet Allaah and Allaah hates to meet 
    him.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6507) and Muslim (2683).
    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:

    This dislike of death is a natural dislike which stems from a 
    feeling of aversion, which is difficult to bear. Undoubtedly it exists in 
    everyone, except the one who Allaah blesses with love for Him and he 
    realized the beauty of being close to Him. That person’s love for Allaah 
    overwhelms him and he will say when it is his time to depart this world, 
    addressing death and its agonies, as Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: A beloved one has come at a time most needed, and the one who has 
    any regrets today will never prosper, so take my soul as You will, for by 
    You, my hearts loves You.
    al-Mufhim, 2/644
    If this meaning is established in your heart and soul, and 
    you have done righteous deeds in preparation for the day of departure from 
    this transient life, death will not harm you if Allaah wills, and your fear 
    of it will be no more than a reason to make you do good and turn to Allaah, 
    not a reason for doom, anxiety, panic or frustration.
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the 
    following question:

    Should the believer not be afraid of death? If that happens, 
    does that mean that he does not want to meet Allaah?
    He replied:

    Believing men and women must fear Allaah and put their hope 
    in Him, because Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the 
    meaning):
    “so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) 
    believers”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:175]
    “Therefore fear not men but fear Me”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:44]
    “and fear none but Me”

    [al-Baqarah 2: 40]
    “Verily, those who have believed, and those who have 
    emigrated (for Allaah’s religion) and have striven hard in the way of 
    Allaah, all these hope for Allaah’s Mercy”

    [al-Baqarah 2:218]
    “So whoever hopes for the Meetingwith 
    his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the 
    worship of his Lord”

    [al-Kahf 18:110]

    There are many similar verses.
    It is not permissible for the believer, male or female, to 
    despair of the mercy of Allaah or feel secure against the plan of Allaah. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against 
    themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of 
    Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most 
    Merciful”

    [al-Zumar 39:53]
    “and never give up hope of Allaah’s Mercy. Certainly no 
    one despairs of Allaah’s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve”

    [Yoosuf 12:87]
    “Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allaah? 
    None feels secure from the Plan of Allaah except the people who are the 
    losers”

    [al-A’raaf 7:99]

    All the Muslims, both male and female, must prepare for death 
    and beware of being heedless, because of the verses quoted above and because 
    of what is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon 
    him) who said: “ Frequently remember the destroyer of pleasures – death.”
    and because being heedless about it and not preparing for it 
    are among the causes of a bad end. It is proven that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of 
    Allaah upon him) said: “Whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet 
    him, and whoever hates to meet Allaah, Allaah hates to meet him.” I said: O 
    Prophet of Allaah, do you mean hating death, for all of us hate death? He 
    said: “It is not like that, but the believer, when he is given glad tidings 
    of Allaah's mercy, pleasure and Paradise, loves to meet Allaah and Allaah 
    loves to meet him. But the disbeliever, when he is given tidings of Allaah’s 
    punishment and wrath, hates to meet Allaah and Allaah hates to meet him.” 
    Agreed upon.
    This hadeeth indicates that there is nothing wrong with 
    disliking or fearing death, and that does not indicate that a person does 
    not want to meet Allaah, because when the believer dislikes death or fears 
    its approach, he wants to do more acts of obedience to Allaah and do more to 
    prepare to meet Him. Similarly when the believing woman fears death and does 
    not want it to come to her, she is only doing that in the hope that she can 
    do more acts of obedience and prepare to meet her Lord. End quote.

    And Allaah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/263/biography-of-the-prophet,"What is your opinion of Ibn Ishaaq? I have heard that his narration of hadith was not very sound and he was not precise in his narration of hadith, which caused the scholars not to accept any report from him. Is this correct?","Praise
      be to Allah.

      The biography of al-‘Allaamah Muhammad ibn Ishaaq may be 
      discussed as follows:
    1.
    His name, lineage and place of birth

    His name was Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Yasaar. His grandfather 
    Yasaar was one of the freed slaves of Qays ibn Makhramah ibn al-Muttalib, so 
    he is known as al-Qurashi al-Muttalibi by virtue of being their freed slave. 
    His kunya was Abu Bakr or, it was said, Abu ‘Abdullah. He was born in 80 AH 
    in al-Madinah al-Munawwarah, may blessings and peace be upon the best of its 
    inhabitants. It was not long before he departed from there in order to seek 
    knowledge and hear hadith, and he settled in Baghdad where he remained until 
    he died (may Allah have mercy on him).
    2.
    His acqusition of knowledge from his shaykhs

    His early academic career was in the greatest seat [?] of 
    knowledge, namely the noble city of the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him), Madinah. He studied and acquired knowledge from its 
    scholars and fuqaha’, and heard hadith from its muhadditheen (hadith 
    scholars). Thus he attained the highest levels of learning, and it was said 
    that he met the noble Sahaabi Anas ibn Maalik, and the leader of the 
    Taabi‘eenSa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab.
    Among the most well-known of his shaykhs were: Sa‘eed al-Maqbiri, 
    ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Hormuz, ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem at-Taymi, 
    Abu Ja‘far al-Baaqir, az-Zuhri, ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Hazm, Muhammad 
    ibn al-Munkadir and many others.
    He travelled in the pursuit of knowledge at an early stage of 
    his life to Mesopotamia, Kufa, ar-Rayy and Baghdad, and he even reached 
    Alexandria during his travels in 115 AH, and he narrated from a number of 
    Egyptian scholars. Ibn Sa‘d (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that he 
    left Madinah a long time ago, but no one among them narrated from him except 
    Ibraaheem ibn Sa‘d. He was with al-‘Abbaas ibn Muhammad in Mesopotamia, and 
    he came to Abu Ja‘far in al-Heerah, for whom he wrote al-Maghaazi. 
    The people of Kufa heard reports from him for that reason, and the people of 
    ar-Rayy also heard reports from him. Therefore his narrators among the 
    people of these cities are more numerous than those who narrated from him 
    among the people of Madinah.
    3.
    His scholarly status

    Ibn Ishaaq was held in high esteem among the scholars of his 
    own time, because of the vastness of his knowledge. Imam adh-Dhahabi said of 
    him: He was the first one to write down knowledge in Madinah; that was 
    before Maalik and Dhawayh. He was like a wondrous ocean of knowledge, but he 
    was not as precise as he should have been.
    Therefore scholarly praise of him was persistent from the 
    earliest times.
    ‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The 
    hadith of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    was mainly conveyed by six – and he mentioned them, then he said: And 
    knowledge of the six ended up with twelve, one of whom is Muhammad ibn 
    Ishaaq.
    Imam az-Zuhri said: There is a great deal of knowledge in 
    Madinah so long as Ibn Ishaaq remains among them.
    4.
    His vast knowledge of maghaazi (Prophet’s military 
    campaigns) and siyar (Prophet’s biography)

    Muhammad ibn Ishaaq is famous for his intense interest in 
    knowledge of maghaazi (Prophet’s military campaigns), as he was the first 
    one to compile the reports of maghaazi into a book. Imam ash-Shaafa‘i (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) said concerning him: Whoever wants to acquire 
    detailed knowledge of maghaazi has no choice but to rely on Muhammad ibn 
    Ishaaq. Ibn ‘Adiyy said: If Ibn Ishaaq had no virtue other than the fact 
    that he diverted rulers from focusing on books from which nothing may be 
    learned to focusing on the military campaigns of the Messenger of Allah 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), how his mission began, and the 
    beginning of creation, this virtue would be enough to put him ahead of 
    others. Imam adh-Dhahabi said: He was a great scholar of maghaazi.
    5.
    His books

    His book for which he is famous – and we have not come across 
    any other work by him – is the famous book which is known as al-Maghaazi. 
    It has not yet appeared in full; rather part of it has been published, 
    annotated by Dr. Muhammad Hameedullah. The same portion has also been 
    published with annotation by Dr. Suhayl Zakkaar. We hope that it will be 
    published in full shortly, by Allah’s leave. But the book has been preserved 
    for us through Ibn Hishaam’s abridgement, in what is known as as-Seerah 
    an-Nabawiyyah li Ibn Hishaam (the Seerah or Prophetic Biography of Ibn 
    Hishaam), who narrated the Maghaazi of Ibn Ishaaq from the student of Ibn 
    Ishaaq, Ziyaad al-Bakaa’i (d. 183 AH).
    6.
    Scholarly praise for his hadith

    Shu‘bah ibn al-Hajjaaj said concerning him: He was the ameer 
    al-mu’mineen in hadith.
    Abu Mu‘aawiyah ad-Dareer said: Ibn Ishaaq was one of the 
    people with the best memory. If a man had fifty hadiths or more, and he left 
    them with Ibn Ishaaq, he would say: Memorise them for me, then if I forget 
    them, you will have preserved them for me.
    Sufyaan ath-Thawri said: I sat with Ibn Ishaaq seventy-odd 
    years ago, and none of the people of Madinah made any accusations against 
    him or said anything bad about him.
    ‘Ali ibn ‘Abdullah said: I looked in the books of Ibn Ishaaq 
    and I did not find anything about which I had any reservations, apart from 
    two hadiths, but they may still have been sound and saheeh.
    7.
    Response to those who criticisedhim

    The criticisms that were made against Ibn Ishaaq may be 
    summed up in eight points:
    (i)
    He was accused of being a Qadari, and it was even said 
    that he was flogged for this reason.

    (ii)
    He was accused of being a Shi‘i.

    These two issues – if they are proven to be true – do not 
    have any impact on his hadith, because the scholars continued to accept 
    hadith from Qadaris and Shi‘ah if it was proven that they were truthful and 
    honest and had good memories.
    (iii)
    He was accused of tadlees (deliberately 
    using ambiguous words in order to mislead)
    He was mentioned by Ibn Hajar in the fourth level of those 
    who used tadlees, in Maraatib al-Mudalliseen (p. 51). He said: He was 
    known for using tadlees (deliberately using ambiguous words in order to 
    mislead) in reports from da‘eef (weak) and majhool (unknown) narrators, and 
    from narrators who were worse than them, and he was described in such terms 
    by Ahmad, ad-Daaraqutni and others.
    This is not to be regarded as casting aspersions on his 
    hadith in general terms either. Hadith may be accepted from one who engaged 
    in tadlees a great deal if he clearly states that he heard the hadith 
    directly; rather what is to be rejected is the reports he narrated by saying 
    ‘an (from, i.e., stating that a report was narrated from So and so without 
    stating that he heard it, and so on).
    (iv)
      He was accused of lying

    This is a false accusation which has not been proven, even 
    though he was accused of this by Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah (d. 146 AH), Maalik ibn 
    Anas (d. 179 AH) and Yahya al-Qattaan (d. 198 AH).

     With regard to the accusation of Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah that he 
    lied – which Yahya al-Qattaan took from him  – the reason for that is that 
    he said: Ibn Ishaaq narrates from my wife Faatimah bint al-Mundhir, but by 
    Allah he never saw her.
    This reason is not sufficient to accuse a great scholar such 
    as Ibn Ishaaq of lying. It may be that he heard from her from behind a 
    screen, without seeing her, or it may be that he heard from her before she 
    married Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah. In fact adh-Dhahabi said: It may be that she was 
    one of the maternal aunts through breastfeeding of Ibn Ishaaq, so he could 
    enter upon her, and Hishaam was not aware that she was his maternal aunt or 
    paternal aunt.
    Sufyaan ath-Thawri said: Ibn Ishaaq told me that she had 
    narrated hadith to him and that he had entered upon her.
    Adh-Dhahabi said: He was telling the truth about that, 
    without a doubt, and Hishaam was telling the truth in his oath. So he did 
    not see her, and the man did not claim that he saw her; rather he stated 
    that she narrated hadith to him. We have heard (hadith) from a number of 
    women, and we did not see them, and by the same token, a number of the 
    Taabi‘een narrated from ‘Aa’ishah, and they never saw her at all.
    ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad said: I told my father the hadith of Ibn 
    Ishaaq and he said: Why did Hishaam deny it? Perhaps he came and asked 
    permission to enter upon her and she gave him permission – i.e., and he (Hishaam) 
    was not aware of that.
    With regard to Imam Maalik regarding him as having lied and 
    describing him as a charlatan, the scholars did not accept that from him, 
    because he did not mention any evidence for regarding him as having lied. A 
    number of the scholars, such as Ibn Ishaaq, Ibn Abi Dhi’b and Ibn al-Maajishon, 
    had a dispute with Imam Maalik and there was some animosity between them, so 
    some of the later scholars did not accept what some of them said about some 
    others, because of what was known about the animosity between them. By the 
    same token, they did not accept what Ibn Ishaaq said about Imam Maalik: Give 
    me some of his books so that I can highlight some of their faults; I know 
    about his books.
    Ya‘qoob ibn Shaybah said: I asked ‘Ali – i.e., ibn al-Madeeni 
    –: How is the hadith of Ibn Ishaaq in your view –is it saheeh?
    He said: Yes, his hadith is saheeh in my view.
    I said: What about Maalik’s comments concerning him?
    He said: Maalik did not sit with him and he did not know him. 
    What hadith did Ibn Ishaaq narrate in Madinah?
    I said: And Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah spoke against him.
    ‘Ali said: What Hishaam said does not count as proof. Perhaps 
    he entered upon his wife when he was still a boy and heard from her. His 
    hadith appears to be truthful. On one occasion he narrated: Abu’z-Zinnaad 
    told me, and on one occasion he said: Abu’z-Zinnaad stated, and he narrated 
    from a man, from someone who heard him say: Sufyaan ibn Sa‘eed told me, from 
    Saalim Abu’n-Nadr, from ‘Umayr: “Fasting on the Day of ‘Arafah.” He was one 
    of those who narrated the most from Abu’n-Nadr. And he said: al-Hasan ibn 
    Dinar told me, from Ayyoob, from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb: “With regard to loans 
    connected to transactions”, and he was one of those who narrated the most 
    from ‘Amr.
    Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We do 
    not claim that the leading scholars of al-jarh wa’t-ta‘deel (evaluation of 
    hadith narrators) were infallible and did not occasionally make mistakes or 
    speak harshly about those with whom there was some ill feeling or animosity. 
    It is known that much of what peers say about one another is to be ignored 
    and does not count for anything, especially if the man is regarded as 
    trustworthy by a group of scholars who sound fair-minded in what they say. 
    These two men – i.e., Maalik and Ibn Ishaaq – each criticised the other, but 
    what Maalik said about Muhammad being somewhat imprecise in narration had an 
    impact of Ibn Ishaaq’s reputation, whereas what Muhammad said concerning 
    Maalik did not have any impact. Maalik rose to high status and became like a 
    star, and the other one – i.e., Ibn Ishaaq – also attained relatively high 
    status, especially in the field of biography.
    (v)
    He was accused of differing with trustworthy narrators.

    (vi)
    He was accused of being the sole narrator of some munkar 
    (odd) reports.

    Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Qaadi Abu 
    Ayyoob spoke the truth when he said: Whoever seeks out strange hadiths, his 
    hadiths will be rejected. This is one of the gravest faults of Ibn Ishaaq. 
    He wrote down hadiths from everyone without any restraint.
    Therefore Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah be pleased with 
    him) did not approve of the hadiths of Ibn Ishaaq.
    Ya‘qoob ibn Shaybah said: I heard Ibn Numayr say, when he 
    mentioned Ibn Ishaaq:
    When he narrates from well-known narrators from whom he heard 
    directly, then he is hasan al-hadith and sadooq (trustworthy). But his 
    problem is that he narrates invalid hadiths from unknown narrators.
    Ishaaq ibn Ahmad ibn Khalaf al-Bukhaari al-Haafiz said: I 
    heard Muhammad ibn Ismaa‘eel say:
    Muhammad ibn Ishaaq has a thousand hadiths narrated by him 
    alone, that he does not have in common with anyone else.
    Ahmad said: Ibn Ishaaq came to Baghdad, and he did not care 
    from whom he narrated, from al-Kalbi or anyone else.
    And he said: He cannot be quoted as evidence. ‘Abu’l-‘Abbaas 
    ibn ‘Uqdah said: I heard ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal say: My father used 
    to seek out the hadith of Ibn Ishaaq and write it down and narrate it in the
    Musnad. It was said to him: Did he quote it as evidence? He said: He 
    did not quote it as evidence with regard to issues having to do with the 
    Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).
    Al-‘Aqeeli said: al-Khidr ibn Dawood told me: Ahmad ibn 
    Muhammad told me: I said to Abu ‘Abdullah: What do you say about Ibn Ishaaq? 
    He said: He engaged in tadlees a great deal. I said: If he says, [So and so] 
    informed me, [So and so] told me, is he trustworthy? He said: He says, [So 
    and so] told me, but he may still engage in tadlees.
    There are differing reports from Ibn Ma‘een concerning his 
    verdict on the hadith of Ibn Ishaaq. An-Nasaa’i said: He is not qawiy 
    (strong). Abu Haatim said: His hadith may be written down. Ad-Daaraqutni 
    said: His hadith may not be quoted as evidence.
    However the words of those who criticised him do not 
    undermine his narration: rather that brings his hadith down to the level of 
    hasan, and his hadith is to be deemed da‘eef only in the event of tadlees or 
    if he is the only one to narrate a ghareeb hadith, not in all instances.
    Ibn ‘Adiyy said: I examined his hadith a great deal, and I 
    did not find any of his hadith that would lead one to state categorically 
    that he is da‘eef. But he may make mistakes, or be confused sometimes, as 
    others also made mistakes, but trustworthy narrators and leading scholars 
    did not refrain from narrating from him, and there is nothing wrong with 
    him.
    (vii)
    His narration of Israa’eeliyyaat [reports from Jewish 
    sources]

    Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) responded to 
    this issue by saying:
    What is wrong with narrating Israa’eeliyyaat from the People 
    of the Book, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    said: “Narrate from the Children of Israel, and there is nothing wrong with 
    that” and he said: “If the People of the Book tell you something, do not 
    believe them and do not disbelieve them”? This is Prophetic permission 
    allowing us to listen to what they narrate in general, as some scholars 
    listened to what they narrated concerning medicine. But none of that can be 
    quoted as evidence; rather evidence is to be found in the Qur’an and Sunnah. 
    End quote.
    Mizaan al-I‘tidaal 
    (6/58).
    (viii)
    Combining the words of the shaykhs

    Ayyoob ibn Ishaaq ibn Saafiri said: I asked Ahmad ibn Hanbal: 
    If a hadith is narrated only by Ibn Ishaaq, do you accept it? He said: No, 
    by Allah, for I see him narrate a single hadith from a number of people, but 
    he does not differentiate between the words of this one or that one.
    This issue does not mean that all of his hadiths are da‘eef. 
    Rather it means that caution is required with regard to cases where it is 
    not certain whether Ibn Ishaaq combined the wordings of different shaykhs 
    and mixed them together. That is because it is important to differentiate 
    between the words of trustworthy narrators and those of others.
    8.
    His death

    He (may Allah have mercy on him) died in the city of Baghdad 
    in 151 AH, according to the more correct view, which was favoured by 
    adh-Dhahabi.

    The ruling on the hadith of Ibn Ishaaq may be summed up in 
    the words of Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him):
    With regard to hadith on fiqhi rulings, his hadith concerning 
    them go down from the level of saheeh to the level of hasan, except in the 
    case of reports narrated only by him, which are to be regarded as munkar 
    [odd]. This is my view concerning him, and Allah knows best.
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    The reports which are narrated by him alone, even if they do 
    not reach the level of saheeh, they are of the level of hasan, if he clearly 
    states that the narrator told him directly. End quote.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/121/taraaweeh-prayers-and-laylat-al-qadar,"In one of the fatwas on your website, you said that whoever prays Taraweeh with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded for him as if he spent the entire night in prayer. Here in our mosque, in the last ten nights of Ramadan, they pray Taraweeh with twenty rak‘ahs, along with three rak‘ahs of Witr, after ‘Isha’. Then they pray tahajjud a few hours before before sahoor, sometimes with eight rak‘ahs, along with three rak‘ahs of Witr. How should we pray in this situation, so that we can guarantee that we will attain the reward of spending the entire night in prayer?","Praise be to Allah
It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said concerning Taraweeh prayer: Whoever prays qiyaam with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded for him as if he spent an entire night in prayer.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (806); he said: This is a saheeh hasan hadith. Also narrated by Abu Dawood (1375). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (2/193). 
This virtue is for the one who prays Taraweeh with the imam and finishes with him. 
The end of Taraweeh prayer and its completion at which the imam finishes has been defined by Islamic teaching as being Witr prayer, as is narrated in saheeh reports from the instructions and actions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). 
It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the last of your prayers at night Witr.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (998) and Muslim (751). 
Whether the prayer is directly after ‘Isha’ or at the end of the night, in order to attain the virtue of praying during the last third of the night, all of that is prescribed. 
It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fears that he will not get up at the end of the night, let him pray Witr at the beginning. Whoever is sure that he will get up at the end of the night, let him pray Witr at the end, for prayer at the end of the night is witnessed, and that is better.” Narrated by Muslim (755).
Based on that, whoever prays twenty rak‘ahs with the first congregation after ‘Isha’ prayer, and prays Witr with the imam of that congregation, has completed Taraweeh prayer by praying Witr with the imam, and has fulfilled the condition of attaining the reward of spending the entire night in prayer by finishing with the imam, and he does not have to pray with another imam at the end of the night, because the first prayer is complete. 
Whoever wants to pray both prayers, seeking more reward, is doing something good, but he should not pray Witr twice, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade doing that. 
It was narrated from Qays ibn Talq ibn ‘Ali, from his father, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There should not be two Witrs in one night.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (470); classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (2/481). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi (470). 
In that case, he has two options, each of which was the view of a group of scholars: 
The first option: when he prays with the first imam and prays Witr with him, he may add a rak‘ah so that it will become even-numbered, then at the end of the night if he wants, he may join the other imam in his prayer and join him in Witr too. 
The second option: he may pray the first Witr as such, then when the second imam prays Witr  at the end of the night, he may either leave and not pray with him, or he may pray with him and add another rak‘ah, intending it to be qiyaam al-layl. 
At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The scholars differed concerning the one who prays Witr at the beginning of the night then prays qiyaam at the end of the night…
Some of the scholars among the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and others said: If he prays Witr at the beginning of the night, then sleeps, then gets up at the end of the night, he may offer whatever prayers he likes, but he should leave his Witr as it was. This is the view of Sufyaan ath-Thawri, Maalik ibn Anas, Ibn al-Mubaarak, ash-Shaafa‘i, the scholars of Kufah, and Ahmad. 
This is more correct, because it was narrated via more than one isnaad that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed after Witr.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/177/adulteryfornication-and-homosexuality,"I am in a relationship with a man who took my virginity. I repented from such evil deeds and ask Allah to accept my repentance. This man proposed to me, but he is not religious, he smokes cigarettes and hashish and drinks alcohol. What should I do, he knows my matter. Or shall I leave him and have a hymen repair operation done and marry a religious man? I was pregnant and I aborted the baby. Allah knows how sincere my repentance is.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    Firstly:
    Zina 
    (fornication or adultery) is a major sin. Allaah has forbidden doing the 
    things that lead to it and has prescribed the hadd punishment for the one 
    who does it, and He has warned adulterers of punishment in the Hereafter.
    Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “And come 
    not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that 
    transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way that leads one to 
    hell unless Allaah forgives him”

    [al-Isra’ 
    17:32].
    Ibn Jareer 
    al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    “And come 
    not near” O people
    “to 
    unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its 
    limits: a great sin)”. Zina (translated here as “unlawful sex”) is a 
    great sin. 
    “and an 
    evil way” i.e., the way of zina is an evil way, because it is the way of 
    the people who disobey Allaah and go against His command; what a bad way is 
    the way that leads a person to the fire of Hell.
    Tafseer 
    al-Tabari 
    (17/438).
    Shaykh ‘Abd 
    al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
    The 
    prohibition on approaching it is more eloquent than a simple prohibition on 
    doing it, because that includes the prohibition on all the things that lead 
    to it and promote it, because “the one who grazes his flock around a 
    protected areas will soon transgress upon it,” especially in a matter of 
    this nature when the motive is very strong. Allaah describes zina as 
    abhorrent, as He says “it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses 
    its limits: a great sin)”, i.e., it is a sin which is abhorrent 
    according to sharee’ah, reason and common sense, because it is a 
    transgression against Allaah, and against the woman and her family or 
    husband, and it leads to immorality, confusion of lineages and other evil 
    consequences.
    “and an 
    evil way” means: what an evil way is the way of the one who dares to 
    commit this grave sin.

    answers to questions no. 76060,

    Secondly:
    With regard to 
    the abortion, if the soul had been breathed into the foetus, then this is 
    another crime in addition to the crime of zina. If the soul had not yet been 
    breathed into the foetus then it is less serious.

    discussion on that, please see the answers to questions no.

    13319,
    13331 and
    90054.
    Thirdly:
    We praise 
    Allaah for having enabled you to repent, and we hope that it is sincere 
    repentance. The conditions of sincere repentance include: regretting the 
    sins that you have committed, and immediately giving up that immoral action, 
    and everything that leads to it such as contact, correspondence and dates. 
    The conditions of repentance also include resolving not to return to this 
    deed.
    You also have 
    to do a lot of righteous deeds, such as prayer, reading Qur’aan and fasting, 
    so as to strengthen your faith and piety. Good deeds erase bad deeds and 
    sincere repentance erases that which came before it, and turns bad deeds 
    into good deeds. Allaah says – after mentioning the sins of shirk 
    (associating others with Allaah), murder and zina – (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
    “Except 
    those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous 
    deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah 
    is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”  

    [al-Furqaan 
    25:70].
    Fourthly:
    With regard to 
    marrying that criminal, you should understand that in order for the marriage 
    of a man and woman who had committed zina to be valid, it is essential that 
    they repent sincerely. It seems to us from your questions that he has not 
    repented from what he did, rather he had added to the first calamity the 
    other bad things that he is doing, such as smoking hasheesh and drinking 
    intoxicants. What we think is that one who is like this also does not pray. 
    If this is indeed the case, then it is definitely not permissible to accept 
    him as a husband, because not praying is kufr that puts a person beyond the 
    pale of Islam, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a 
    kaafir.

    detailed discussion on the issue of marrying a zaani (one who commits 
    fornication or adultery), please see the answers to questions no.
    85335,
    87894 and
    96460.
    Fifthly:
    With regard to 
    having an operation to repair the hymen, this is haraam, because it is 
    deceiving the one who marries you.
    For a detailed 
    discussion of this matter, please see the answer to question no.
    844.
    With regard to 
    telling your future husband that you lost your virginity in this haraam 
    relationship, that is not permissible, because it is exposing your faults, 
    and the Muslim is required to conceal his faults. You can use double 
    entendres in your speech. It is well known that the hymen may be broken by 
    means of something other than intercourse in some cases, so you can make the 
    most of that by using a double entendre.
    See the answer 
    to question no. 42992.
    But if it is 
    possible to encourage this person to repent sincerely and pray regularly, 
    and he shows sincerity and signs of repenting and praying regularly, then 
    there is nothing wrong with accepting him as a husband. Undoubtedly this 
    solution would be easier for you, and more concealing for you, but how could 
    one believe a person like that?!
    We ask Allaah 
    to accept your repentance and set your affairs straight, and to conceal our 
    faults and yours in this world and in the Hereafter.
    And Allaah 
    knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/119/al-itikaaf,"Our mosque has two places that are separate, outside the mosque. We had got used to praying in this place, but since construction on the mosque was completed, we pray inside the mosque. Is it permissible for us to observe i‘tikaaf in these two places?.","Praise be to Allaah.
I‘tikaaf means staying in the mosque to worship Allah, and it is something that is done only in the mosques and is not valid if done elsewhere. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I‘tikaaf observed anywhere but in a mosque is not valid if the person observing i‘tikaaf is a man. We do not know of any difference among the scholars concerning this. The basic principle with regard to that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. So it is something that is only for the mosques. If it were valid to preserve i‘tikaaf anywhere else, the prohibition on intimacy would not have been mentioned only with regard to the mosques, because intimacy is forbidden during i‘tikaaf in all cases. According to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, she said: “The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to put his head into (my room) when he was in the mosque, and I would comb his hair. He did not enter the house except for some need when he was observing i‘tikaaf.” Al-Daaraqutni narrated with his isnaad from al-Zuhri, from ‘Urwah and Sa‘eed ibn al-Musayyab from ‘Aa’ishah in a hadeeth: The Sunnah is for the person who is observing i‘tikaaf not to go out except for necessary purposes, and there is no i‘tikaaf except in a mosque where prayers are offered in congregation (jamaa ‘ah).
End quote from al-Mughni, 3/65 
With regard to this separate place, it does not seem that it is part of the mosque that is built for prayer, so it is not valid to observe i‘tikaaf there. The guideline in defining what is included in the rooms of the mosque and what is not included is as follows: 
1.If the room that is connected to the mosque was built to be a mosque, i.e., the builder of the mosque intended it to be part of the mosque in which prayers are offered, then it comes under the same rulings as the mosque and it is permissible to observe i‘tikaaf there, and women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth (nifaas) should not be allowed to enter it.
But if it was intended to be extra space for teaching or holding meetings, or as accommodation for the imam or muezzin, and not as a place for prayer, it does not come under the same rulings as a mosque in that case. 
2.If the intention of the one who built the mosque is not known, then the basic principle is that whatever is within the wall of the mosque and has a door into the mosque comes under the same rulings as the mosque.
3.The courtyard that is enclosed within the wall of the mosque comes under the same rulings as the mosque.
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The walls of the mosque, both inside and outside, comes under the same rulings as the mosque and it is obligatory to protect them and respect their sanctity. The same applies to its roof, the well inside it, and its courtyard. Al-Shaafa‘i and his companions (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that it is valid to observe i‘tikaaf in its courtyard or on its roof, and the prayer of one who follows an imam who is inside the mosque in these places is valid.
End quote from al-Majmoo‘, 2/207 
It says in Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha (2/234): Also included as part of the mosque are its roof and its enclosed courtyard. Al-Qaadi said: If it has a wall and gate, then they are like the mosque, because they are part of it and belong to it. If it is not enclosed, then it does not come under the same rulings as the mosque. Also part of the mosque is the minaret, if it or its door is in the mosque; but if it or its gate is outside, even if they are close, and the person who is observing i‘tikaaf goes out to them to give the adhaan, his i‘tikaaf is rendered invalid. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: With regard to a room that is inside the mosque, is it permissible to observe i‘tikaaf in it? He replied: That depends. The one who studies the words of the fuqaha’ in general will say that it is part of the mosque, because they say that the room that is enclosed by the walls of the mosque are part of the mosque. But the one who thinks that it was not built as part of the mosque and that it is a room for the imam, will regard it as being like the houses of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because the houses of the Messenger had doors that opened into the mosque, but despite that they were houses and the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not go out to them [i.e., during i‘tikaaf]. So to be on the safe side, the one who is observing i‘tikaaf should not do it there. But the custom of people nowadays is that rooms that are in the mosques are regarded as being part of the mosque.

When she was advised to stop doing this she said he is a relative and it is permissible. She also talks to him on the telephone. She does not know that I know about this matter, what shall I do?

    Firstly:
    Undoubtedly this sister is in need of advice and guidance, 
    and the one who is said to be a righteous man who is one of her relatives 
    needs the same. There is no doubt that by means of this relationship they 
    are opening a door to fitnah and a path to sin and transgression, and no one 
    can be certain of what the consequences of that will be, and no one knows 
    where it will end up.
    It was narrated from al-Nawwaas ibn Sam’aan al-Ansaari (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has told the parable of a 
    straight path, on both sides of which are two walls, in which there are open 
    doors, and over the doors are curtains, and at the gate of the path there is 
    a caller who says: ‘O people, enter the path all together and do not go 
    depart from it. And there is a caller who calls from further in; when a 
    person wants to open any of those doors, he says: Woe to you, do not open 
    it! for if you open it you will enter it.
    The path is Islam and the walls are the sacred limits of 
    Allaah, and the open doors are the things forbidden by Allaah. The caller at 
    the beginning of the path is the Book of Allaah and the caller at the top of 
    the path is the conscience in the heart of every Muslim.”
    Narrated by Imam Ahmad (17182) and classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Zilaal al-Jannah (19).
    The word “woe to you” is a warning against doing that; it is 
    a word that expresses mercy and concern and it is said to anyone who falls 
    into a bad situation that he does not deserve.
    “Do not open it, for if you open it you will enter it” means 
    you will enter the door and fall into that which Allaah has forbidden. 
    Fayd al-Qadeer (4/334).
    Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
    The one who in this world departs from the straight path and 
    opens the doors to haraam things that are in the walls of the path, right 
    and left, and enters them, whether he entered the haraam things because of 
    whims and desires or confusion, will be seized by the hooks that are on that 
    path, right and left, according to whatever doors to haraam things he opened 
    in this world, and some of them will fall into the Fire, and some will be 
    torn by the hooks then saved.

    p. 44.
    The relationship mentioned in the question dictates two 
    things:
    1 – That the relative should be concerned about his 
    relatives’ well being and be more concerned about protecting them than 
    anyone else. So he should not help his relative to open doors to haraam or 
    enter them, whether that is motivated by whims and desires or confusion, 
    rather his concern for his relative should be firstly because he is a Muslim 
    and then because he is a relative.
    2 – Many people are careless about mixing between relatives, 
    and there are not many who do not overstep the limit and refrain from 
    slipping into areas of fitnah. Therefore Islam is strict in closing the door 
    to fitnah caused by relatives with whom people tend to feel too relaxed more 
    than others, to such a point that the relative is likened to death! 
    It was narrated from ‘Utbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of 
    entering upon women.” An Ansaari man said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about 
    the in-law? He said: “The in-law is death.”  Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4934) 
    and Muslim (2172). 
    For the commentary of Imam al-Nawawi on this hadeeth, please 
    see the answer to question no. 12837.
    In the answer referred to there is also a fatwa from Shaykh 
    ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) about the 
    permissibility of a woman sitting with her relatives, subject to two 
    conditions:
    1 – That her hijab should be complete, including the face and 
    hands.

    2 – That there should be nothing dubious.
    Both conditions are lacking in this case. She sits with her 
    relatives with her face uncovered, and undoubtedly her sitting with him is 
    dubious. Among the effects of that sitting together are the conversations 
    that have taken place between them, which are also haraam. We have quoted 
    the fatwas of the scholars about this issue in the answers to questions no.
    26890 and
    10221.
    Secondly:
    You have to be subtle in calling her, advising her and 
    reminding her, and you must use wisdom and beautiful exhortation. Kindness 
    in offering advice is more likely to bring a response and moving exhortation 
    is more likely to affect the heart. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Invite (mankind, O Muhammad 
    صلىالله عليه وسلم) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom 
    (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and 
    argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has 
    gone astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided”

    [al-Nahl 16:125]
    “Go, both of you, to Fir‘awn (Pharaoh), verily, he has 
    transgressed (all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an 
    arrogant and as a tyrant).

    44. “And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept 
    admonition or fear (Allaah)”

    60244 and
    13261.
    If you are afraid that she will be put her off if you are 
    blunt with her, or you think that she will be stubborn, then you can give 
    her hints concerning what you want to tell her, and talk to her indirectly, 
    such as quoting some ahaadeeth in front of her that warn against the fitnah 
    of non-mahram men, especially relatives, or giving her some tapes and essays 
    and pamphlets that speak about that, and about the danger that taking such 
    matters lightly poses to the religious commitment and chastity of a woman, 
    and speak to her in general terms, as if you do not know anything about her 
    situation. 
    Then urge her to convey this message to other Muslim women, 
    when she is calling them to Allaah, and spreading that etiquette among 
    Muslim women, and that it is not sufficient for a girl to protect herself 
    against immorality or the things that lead to it such as haraam mixing and 
    relationships that are Islamically unacceptable, rather she must also call 
    others to Allaah and enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, as much as 
    she is able to. 
    Thirdly:
    If this indirect approach does not succeed, then you can 
    gently confront her with what she is doing, as she is a grown up and will 
    understand what you say. She is also a student in a Qur'aan circle and her 
    actions do not reflect on her only but also on the place where she is 
    learning. Tell her that you are telling her this because you love her and 
    you wish her well, and you are concerned about her, and it is not the matter 
    of trying to control another person’s actions, for many people are put off 
    from the truth for no other reason than that they think the person who is 
    advising them is trying to set himself up as his keeper.
    You can focus on a number of things when you advise her:
    1.Explain to her the status of 
    modesty in Islam, and how the wives of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah attained a high 
    degree with regard to this virtue.

    2.Point out to her that she is 
    falling into something that is forbidden in sharee’ah, such as uncovering 
    the face in front of a non-mahram man, sitting in a mixed gathering and 
    talking to him on the pone. We have referred above to numerous fatwas from 
    the scholars on these matters.

    In the answers to questions no.
    11774 and
    21536 we have explained the ruling 
    on covering the face and hands.

    3.Remind her of the true stories 
    of those who fell victim to mixing and talking and corresponding with 
    non-mahrams, as such stories are innumerable.

    See also the answer to question no.
    20784.

    In the answer to question no.
    1200 we have explained the ruling 
    on mixing in detail, and its bad effects.

    4.Get in touch with her mother or 
    visit her to advise her and remind her of the wrong things that are being 
    done in their house, and the effect that this will have on them, and on 
    their daughter in particular.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/146/business-and-financial-transactions,I have bought a piece of land to build a home on it. And I paid one third of its price as a first payment. Then I wanted to sell this land versus a bigger amount of money than that amount I paid as first payment. What is the ruling on this? .,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    It is permissible to buy land and goods – except gold, silver 
    and currency – and delay paying all or some of the price, such as if it is 
    agreed to pay an amount such as one-third or one-quarter, and delay paying 
    the rest until a specified time.
    If the contract is concluded, then the purchaser becomes the 
    owner of the property, and may dispose of it like any other owner. He has 
    the right to sell it or give it away, whilst continuing to pay the 
    instalments that he owes, so long as he does not sell it to the first vendor 
    for a lower price that that which he paid for it, because this is an ‘aynah 
    transaction which is haraam.
    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (9/36): The 
    effects that result from sale are: (i) transfer of ownership, whereby the 
    purchaser takes possession of the item sold and the seller takes possession 
    of the price; ownership of the sold item passes to the purchaser as soon as 
    the valid contract of sale is concluded and does not depend on him 
    physically taking possession of it and handing over money, although 
    physically taking possession and handing over the money counts with regard 
    to liability. End quote.
    It also says (9/40): Handing over the sold item is the most 
    important action to which the seller commits himself in the sale contract, 
    and this is established once the price is handed over. But if the price is 
    delayed, then handing it over is not dependent on handing over the price. 
    End quote.
    In some contracts the seller stipulates that the purchaser 
    will not sell the item – land or anything else – until he has paid off the 
    whole price. This is a permissible condition, which is keeping the land in 
    pledge for its price or until its price is paid off. In that case it is not 
    permissible for the buyer to sell it without the permissible of the first 
    seller.
    See question no. 69877.
    Based on that, if you did not agree with the seller to keep 
    the land in pledge for him until you had paid off its price, then it is 
    permissible for you to sell it for whatever price you wish, whether it is 
    more than you paid for it or less, because you have become the owner of the 
    land and you have the right to dispose of it as you wish.
    And Allaah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/16/unity-of-divine-lordship,Is it correct to attribute ownership and disposal of affairs to created beings when these are actions that should be attributed to Allaah by way of affirming His Oneness?.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    We must believe 
    that Allaah alone has ownership and that no one owns created beings except 
    their Creator, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the 
    earth”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:189]
    “Say: “In Whose Hand is the sovereignty of everything”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:88]
With regard to 
    verses which speak of ownership belonging to someone other than Allaah, such 
    as the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right 
    hands possess,  
    for then, they are free from blame”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:6]
    “or (from that) whereof you hold keys”

    [al-Noor 24:61]

    this differs from the ownership that is attributed to Allaah 
    in several ways, such as:
    1-The ownership of a created 
    being is limited and only includes a few of these created things. A man may 
    own that which is under his control, but he does not own that which is under 
    the control of others.

    2-It is limited, not absolute. A 
    man does not own that which he has in the fullest sense of the word. Hence 
    he can only dispose of it in ways that are permitted in sharee’ah. For 
    example, if he wants to burn his wealth or torture his animal, we say that 
    this is not permitted. But Allaah owns things in a complete and 
    comprehensive sense.

    With regard to saying that Allaah is the only disposer of 
    affairs, this means that a person believes that Allaah is the Only One Who 
    is in control, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky and 
    the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from 
    the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the 
    affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of 
    Allaah’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allaah)?’

    Such is Allaah, your Lord in truth. So after the truth, 
    what else can there be, save error? How then are you turned away?”

    [Yoonus 10:31]
With regard to a 
    man’s disposal of affairs, it is limited to that which is under his control 
    and that which is permitted to him by sharee’ah.
Based on this, 
    there is nothing wrong with attributing ownership and disposal of affairs to 
    a person, but this sovereignty and disposal of affairs is limited. There is 
    no one who owns and controls all things in a comprehensive sense except 
    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. And Allaah knows best.

    See al-Qawl al-Mufeed, 1/13."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/218/supplication,"Allah says: “and say: ""My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young” [al-Isra’ 17:24]. My mother does not pray, and as far as I know, the one who does not pray is beyond the pale of Islam. How can it be permissible for me to pray for mercy for her in that case?
But one of the seekers of knowledge told me that it is permissible for me to pray for her in this fashion only while she is still alive, because Allah may have mercy on her and guide her to start praying. Is this true?

Is it correct for me to offer this supplication for my father? How should I say the du‘aa’ in Arabic if I pray for him? I hope you will pray for my mother and ask Allah to guide her.","Praise be to Allaah.
    
    Firstly:
    We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide your mother to that 
    which He loves and which pleases Him, and to make her one of the devout 
    women who worship Allah, and to grant you the joy of seeing her guided and 
    becoming righteous. And we ask Him to unite your family in obedience to Him 
    in this world and in the highest degrees of Paradise in the Hereafter.
    Secondly:
    What the seeker of knowledge told you about it being 
    permissible to pray for mercy for a non-Muslim while he is still alive is 
    correct in the sense that Allah may bestow mercy upon him by saving him from 
    sin and guiding him to obedience, and thus transferring him from being one 
    of those who are subject to His wrath to being one of those upon whom He 
    bestows His mercy.
    The more correct view, concerning the correctness of which 
    the scholars are unanimously agreed, is that supplication (du‘aa’) may be 
    made for guidance for a kaafir who is still alive, but not for mercy or 
    forgiveness. By doing so, one will avoid an area of scholarly differences 
    concerning this issue.
    Among the evidence that this is more correct is the report 
    narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2739) and Abu Dawood (5038) from Abu Moosa (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Jews would pretend to sneeze in the 
    presence of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) hoping 
    that he would say to them, “May Allah have mercy on you,” but he used to 
    say: “May Allah guide you and set your affairs straight.”
    See the answer to question no.
    43164.
    Thirdly:
    There is no difference of opinion among the scholars that one 
    cannot pray for forgiveness and mercy for a kaafir who died in a state of 
    kufr.
    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    Offering the funeral prayer for a kaafir and praying for 
    forgiveness for him is haraam according to the text of the Qur’aan and 
    scholarly consensus.
    Al-Majmoo‘, 5/119.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    said:
    Praying for forgiveness for a kaafir is not permissible 
    according to the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus.
    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 12/489
    With regard to praying for mercy and forgiveness for a kaafir 
    who is still alive, there are numerous comments of the scholars concerning 
    the permissibility of doing so, but not in the sense of asking for 
    forgiveness for his shirk and kufr if he dies believing in that, or asking 
    for mercy for him from his Lord when he has met Him as a kaafir. Rather, 
    such supplications are to be understood as seeking to achieve that which may 
    be a cause of his being forgiven and shown mercy, which is that he be guided 
    to Islam. This is one of the ways in which we may interpret the words of 
    Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) as mentioned in the verse (interpretation of 
    the meaning): “O my Lord! They have indeed led 
    astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me. And 
    whoso disobeys me, – 
    still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [Ibraaheem 14:36], 
    and the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “O 
    Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (3290) and Muslim (1792).
    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

    “And whoso disobeys me, 
    – still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most 
    Merciful” – it does not say “still You are indeed Almighty, Most 
    Wise”, because the context speaks of seeking the kindness of Allah and of 
    du‘aa’ (supplication) i.e., if You forgive them and have mercy on them by 
    enabling them to recant shirk and accept Tawheed, to give up sin and turn to 
    obedience, as it says in the hadeeth, “O Allah, forgive my people, for they 
    do not know.”
    Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/36, 37
    Badr al-Deen al-‘Ayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said, 
    commenting on the hadeeth, “O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not 
    know”:
    What this means is: guide them to Islam with which 
    forgiveness becomes valid, because the sin of kufr cannot be forgiven. Or it 
    may be that what is meant is: Forgive them if they become Muslim.
    ‘Umdat al-Qaari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 
    23/19
    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned these two interpretations in 
    Fath al-Baari, 11/196
    To sum up:
    It is better to pray that your mother be guided and that 
    Allah open her heart to doing what He has commanded her to do. But if you 
    pray for mercy for her, there is nothing wrong with that, with the intention 
    that Allah may bless her with guidance to do that which earns mercy, i.e., 
    prayer.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/47/rights-of-spouses,What is the ruling on one who has intercourse with his wife when she is fasting the six days of Shawwal and he is not fasting?.,"Praise be to Allah. 
       
    The one who is observing a 
    voluntary fast has the choice: he may complete the fast or he may break it, 
    but completing it is better. 
Ahmad (26535) narrated from 
    Umm Hani (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah 
     (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her. He called 
    for a drink and drank some, then he passed it to her and she drank some. She 
    said: O Messenger of Allah, I was fasting. The Messenger of Allah  
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is observing 
    a voluntary fast has the choice; if he wishes he may fast and if he wishes 
    he may break the fast.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh 
    al-Jami’ (3854). 
Please see also the answer to 
    question no. 49610. 
If a person fasts one of 
    the six days of Shawwal, and he wants to break the fast, he may do so, 
    whether he does it by eating, having intercourse, or anything else. 
If this woman fasted 
    without her husband’s permission, then he may call her to his bed, and she 
    has to respond. 
But if she was fasting with 
    his permission, then he does not have the right to spoil her fast, but if he 
    wants that then it is better for her to respond to him. 
Ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allah have mercy on him) said: If she observes a nafil fast with his 
    permission, then it is not permissible for him to spoil her fast, because he 
    gave her permission. But in that case if she is observing a nafil fast with 
    his permission and he wants her to come to his bed, is it better for her to 
    continue fasting and refuse her husband’s request? The other option is 
    better, which is responding to her husband’s request, because responding to 
    her husband’s request is basically obligatory, and the voluntary fast is 
    mustahabb, and because if she refuses even though his desire is strong, then 
    he may feel some resentment towards her and the relationship between them 
    may be affected as a result of that.

    Secondly:
    If a

    no connection to Fajr prayer, and has nothing to do with the time of Fajr 
    prayer at all, or whether it was done on time or made up later. Rather what 
    is prescribed for one who has fallen short in some deed, or missed out on 
    something good, is to do a lot of good and righteous deeds, the best of 
    which are the naafil (supererogatory) prayers.

    Collectors for electricity 
    companies and other representatives are entrusted with whatever money comes 
    to them, and they have no right to dispose of it in any way other than that 
    for which their bosses have given them permission. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allaah commands 
    that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due”
[al-Nisa’ 4:58]. 
What they must do is give 
    the money to the company as they took it from the customers or subscribers. 
    It is not permissible for them to change it from one currency to another. If 
    they do that, then the additional amount belongs to the company, and they 
    have no right to take anything from it.

Since we were small, she has treated us harshly and has never shown us an ounce of compassion, and we have grown up in this atmosphere. She has never supported me as a girl and has never taught me how to interact with suitors or with people in a feminine way. She never taught me many things pertaining to the life of a girl, and she has fallen short with us in many matters. Will Allah hold her accountable for that, as He will hold a son accountable for his defiance towards his mother and not being kind to her? I hope that you will reply.","Praise be to Allah
Just as the parents have rights over their children, so too the children have rights over their parents.
Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded”
[at-Tahreem 66:6].
And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (893) and Muslim (1829).
And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no person whom Allah puts in charge of others, and when he dies he is insincere to his subjects, but Allah will forbid Paradise to him.” Narrated by Muslim (142).
Therefore children have rights over their parents to which the parents must pay attention. These rights are many and include the following:
1. A man must choose a good wife for himself and a woman must choose a good husband for herself. A man should choose a woman who will be a good mother for his children in the future, and a woman should choose a man who will be a good father to her children.
2. Giving the child a good name, taking care of him, and fulfilling his basic needs of food, drink, clothing and accommodation, according to what one can afford, without falling short or being extravagant.
3. One of the most important rights that children have over their parents is that they should give them a good upbringing and take care of them, paying attention to their manners and behaviour, and their practice of their religion in a manner that is pleasing to Allah, and following up with them regarding worldly matters in such a way that will help them to live a dignified and righteous life.
Many parents fall short with regard to this duty that they owe to their children, then they suffer the consequences of their falling short, which is defiant disobedience from their children, and the children’s mistreatment of them.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Whoever neglects to teach his child that which will benefit him, and leaves him without any guidance, has wronged him gravely. Most children’s deviance is because of their parents and the parents’ neglect and failure to teach them the obligatory religious duties and the sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), so they neglected them when they were small.…
How many are the parents who were the cause of their children’s misfortune and suffering in this world and the hereafter, because of their negligence and failure to discipline the child, and their encouraging and helping him to pursue his whims and desires. By doing that, they think that they are being kind to the child, at the time when they are disgracing him, and they think that they are showing mercy to him at the time when they are wronging him. Thus the child will be of no benefit to his parent, and the parent is the cause of the child’s misfortune and of his missing out on opportunities for success in this world and the hereafter…
If you think of the causes of children’s misguidance and corruption, you will see that it is mostly the fault of the parents.
End quote from Tuhfat al-Mawdood bi Ahkaam al-Mawlood (p. 229, 242).
It should be noted that if the father and mother fall short in raising their child, that does not mean that the child should fall short in his duties towards his parents and mistreat them; rather he has to treat them kindly and forgive any mistreatment on their part towards him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and to parents, good treatment”
[al-Isra’ 17:23]
“But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness”
[Luqmaan 31:15].

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/96/night-prayer,"I hope that you could tell me about the opinions of the scholars with regard to the ruling on dividing Taraweeh prayers in the last ten days of Ramadan into two parts: at the beginning of the night and at the end, as is done in many mosques. Please also mention the evidence if possible.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    What is mustahabb during the nights of Ramadan is to spend 
    them in qiyaam, prayer and worship, and to single out the last ten nights 
    for extra worship and striving, seeking forgiveness and mercy and seeking 
    Laylat al-Qadr which is better than a thousand months.
    Moreover, Taraaweeh prayer is regarded as a kind of Qiyaam 
    al-layl and they call it Taraweeh because people take brief breaks between 
    rak’ahs. Hence the matter is broad in scope, and it is permissible for a 
    person to pray whatever he wants of rak’ahs, at whatever time of the 
    night he wants.
    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (34/123):
    There is no difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ with 
    regard to it being Sunnah to pray during the nights of Ramadan (Qiyaam 
    al-layl), because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever spends the nights of Ramadan in prayer, out of faith and 
    seeking the reward of Allah, his previous sins will be forgiven.”
    The fuqaha’ said: Taraweeh is the qiyaam (Qiyaam al-layl) of 
    Ramadan. Hence it is best to spend most of the night in it, because it is 
    Qiyaam al-layl. End quote.
    What many imams do nowadays -- especially in the last ten 
    days of Ramadan -- leading the people in Taraweeh prayer immediately after 
    ‘Isha’, then going back to the mosque in the last part of the night to pray 
    qiyaam, is something that is prescribed and it is not forbidden. There is no 
    reason to suggest it is not allowed. What is required is to strive hard in 
    the last ten days according to one's ability. If a person breaks up his 
    night between prayer, resting, sleeping, and reading Qur'aan, then he has 
    done well.
    Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah Abaabateen said, as is narrated in 
    al-Durar al-Saniyyah (4/364):
    In response to what some people do of objecting to the one 
    who prays more during the last ten days of Ramadan than he usually did in 
    the first twenty days, on the grounds that this is more than is usual and is 
    ignorance of the Sunnah and the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and 
    imams of Islam,
    We say: There are hadeeths from the Prophet (blessings and 
    peace of Allah be upon him) which encourage praying Qiyaam al-layl during 
    Ramadan, and particularly emphasise it during the last ten days.
    Once it becomes clear that there is no specific number of 
    rak’ahs for Taraweeh, and that the time for it according to all scholars is 
    from after the Sunnah of ‘Isha’ until the break of dawn, and that spending 
    the night in worship is a confirmed Sunnah, and that the Prophet (blessings 
    and peace of Allaah be upon him) prayed taraweeh for many nights in 
    congregation, then how can anyone object to the one who prays more during 
    the last ten nights than he did at the beginning of the month? So during the 
    last ten days, he prays at the beginning of the night, as he did at the 
    beginning of the month, or a little, or a lot, without praying Witr, for the 
    sake of those who are weak and want to limit themselves to that; then after 
    that he does more prayers in congregation and calls all of it qiyaam or 
    taraweeh.
    Perhaps the one who objects to that is confused by what many 
    of the fuqaha’ say, that it is mustahabb for the imam not to pray more than 
    one includes than one khatmah (reading of the entire Qur’aan), unless the 
    people behind him prefer to do more than that. The reason they gave for not 
    doing more than one khatmah is the hardship that may be caused for the 
    people behind him, not because doing more than that is not prescribed in 
    sharee’ah. So from their wording we may conclude that if people behind him 
    want to do more than one khatmah, that is good, as was clearly stated in the 
    words of the scholars.
    As for what many of the common people say, calling what is 
    done at the beginning of the night Taraweeh and the prayers offered after 
    that qiyaam, this is what the uneducated people say. Rather all of it is 
    qiyaam and taraweeh. The qiyaam of Ramadaan is called Taraweeh because they 
    used to have a rest (yastareehoona) after every four rak’ahs because they 
    used to make the prayers lengthy. The reason why some people object to that 
    is that it is contrary to what is customary among the people of their 
    countries and most of the people nowadays; and because of ignorance of the 
    Sunnah and reports and of the practice of the Sahaabah, Taabi’oon and the 
    imams of Islam; and because of what some people think, that our prayer 
    during the last ten days is a kind of salat al-ta’qeeb which was regarded as 
    makrooh by some scholars, but that is not in fact the case, because ta’qeeb 
    is a voluntary prayer offered in congregation after finishing Taraweeh and 
    Witr.
    This is how all the fuqaha’ defined ta’qeeb, as a voluntary 
    prayer offered in congregation after finishing Witr immediately after 
    Taraweeh. From these words it is clear that prayer offered in congregation 
    before Witr is not ta’qeeb. End quote.
    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said in Ithaaf Ahl al-Eemaan bi 
    Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan:
    In the last ten days of Ramadan, the Muslims increase their 
    efforts in worship, following the example of the Prophet (blessings and 
    peace of Allah be upon him) and seeking Laylat al-Qadr which is better than 
    a thousand months. Those who pray twenty-three rak’ahs at the beginning of 
    the month break it up during the last ten days, so they pray ten rak’ahs at 
    the beginning of the night, calling it Taraweeh, and they pray ten at the 
    end of the night, making them lengthy, and following it with three rak’ahs 
    of Witr, which they call qiyaam. This is a variation in naming only. In fact 
    all of it may be called Taraweeh or it may be called qiyaam. As for those 
    who pray eleven or thirteen rak’ahs at the beginning of the month, they add 
    ten rak’ahs to that during the last ten days, which they pray at the end of 
    the night, making it lengthy, making the most of the virtue of the last ten 
    days and increasing their efforts to do good. They have a precedent among 
    the Sahaabah and others who prayed twenty-three rak’ahs, as stated above. 
    Thus they combine the two opinions: the opinion which favours offering 
    thirteen rak’ahs during the first twenty days and the opinion which favours 
    offering twenty-three during the last ten days. End quote.

Which should I choose? Please note that my parents are living in that kaafir land.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    Firstly:
    Hajj is obligatory and should be done straight away, 
    according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. What that means 
    is that Hajj becomes obligatory for the one who is enjoined to perform Hajj 
    as soon as he become able to do it, and it is not permissible for him to 
    delay it with no excuse. See question no.
    41702.
    Secondly:

     Migration from a kaafir land may be obligatory or mustahabb, 
    depending on a person’s situation. If he is able to practise his religion 
    openly and is safe from temptation and fitnah, then he does not have to 
    migrate. But if he cannot practise his religion openly or he fears fitnah 
    for himself, then it is obligatory.
    If migration has become obligatory, but a person does not 
    have enough money to both migrate and do Hajj, then migration should be 
    given precedence, because Hajj is not obligatory unless one has money 
    surplus to one’s basic needs. Obligatory migration comes under the heading 
    of basic needs, so it takes precedence over Hajj.
    Moreover, delaying migration after it becomes necessary 
    affects a Muslim’s religious commitment, but delaying Hajj is permissible if 
    there is an excuse, and there is no harm in that.
    This applies if migration becomes necessary at the time of 
    Hajj, otherwise, if migration becomes necessary before Hajj, then he should 
    do it, then when the time for Hajj comes, if he can afford it, it is 
    obligatory, otherwise it is not obligatory. 
    We ask Allaah to protect you and to make you steadfast in 
    obeying Him.

    Something that goes without saying and that you must always 
    bear in mind is that the human mind is too weak to comprehend all knowledge 
    or understand the essence of the universe or find out all the realities of 
    life, for it is a mind that is limited in capacity and may be very foolish 
    indeed when left to its own devices or when it functions independently, far 
    away from that which could protect it from guidance.

    Its areas of operation should be limited to focusing its 
    efforts on searching, thinking and pondering, and adhering to the type of 
    evidence and proof that the mind of the ordinary, sound human being would be 
    content with – the mind that is not confused by doubts, speculation or 
    specious arguments, and is not unable to reach any level of certainty 
    concerning any matter because of the accumulation of false notions. That is 
    the sound mind that Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) addresses in His 
    holy Book, and that He has made the foundation of accountability. All other 
    minds that are filled with doubts are in need of rehabilitation in order to 
    regain trust in facts and rational principles, and to be able once more to 
    engage with the facts of faith. Insinuating thoughts of atheism – in our 
    view – are more akin to sickness and confusion than to sound scientific 
    thinking that is based on proof and evidence.

     Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation 
    of the meaning):

    “Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able 
    to do all things.

    Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of 
    you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;

    Who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can 
    see no fault in the creations of the Most Beneficent. Then look again: ‘Can 
    you see any rifts?’”

    [al-Mulk 67:1-3].
    Our experience indicates that early youth is the age at which 
    a person is more vulnerable to intellectual confusion and uncertainty about 
    belief. It seems that this matter may be due to some physiological causes; 
    probably one day scientific studies will be able to research this issue, but 
    until then we may attribute this phenomenon to human nature, as it mostly 
    results from curiosity and attraction to anything that is strange or new. 
    Atheism is a new idea for humanity, or it is an individual inclination and a 
    stage that a person may go through; it appears somewhat glamorous because it 
    is something that makes a person stand out and be different from other 
    people. It is as if the one who embraces it is saying, “I am the only one 
    who broke through the chains to which you are accustomed, and that you grew 
    up believing and affirming.” But regardless of its origin, regardless of how 
    this new idea may sound, and regardless of the uniqueness of his new stance 
    by which he wants to stand out, he is like the man who urinated in Zamzam 
    and was asked about that, and he said: “I wanted to be known, even if it is 
    for something bad”!
    It seems that this poor man does not know or does not realize 
    that animals are more rational than he is, because we find that it is as if 
    they believe in cause and effect and they know that any deed must inevitably 
    have a doer. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):

    “Have they not travelled through the land, and have they 
    hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear? Verily, it is not 
    the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the chests that 
    grow blind”

    [al-Hajj 22:46].
    Usually we give examples from the experience of daily life so 
    as to prove to those who experience persistent thoughts of atheism, by means 
    of something tangible, the extent of the intellectual calamity with which 
    they are faced. A person’s daily practices and habits are something sound 
    and natural, and are all based on sound, rational principles. Usually people 
    retain that sound thinking and do not become confused except in cases of 
    insanity – Allah forbid. Hence we may use them to remind the one who is 
    experiencing persistent thoughts of atheism of what is normal, so that he 
    will wake up from his negligence and come back to his senses.
    Therefore, let us give you some examples from daily life, 
    from which there is a great lesson to be learned for someone in your 
    situation.
    Do you think that if you were sitting in your house and you 
    heard the sound of the doorbell, would you hesitate to respond to this 
    sound? Would you not hurry to see who is at the door? What is it that 
    prompts you to hurry in this way? Don’t common sense and logic, on the basis 
    of which we live our lives, tell us that this deed must have a doer, and 
    this effect must have a cause?
    Now imagine with us that you doubt these simple facts because 
    you have let yourself become confused by philosophy, and have started to 
    think of other rational possibilities that could explain this noise (the 
    doorbell), and other theories that could explain what has happened in this 
    situation, such as claiming that it is an accident or coincidence, or that 
    there may be a problem with the electricity supply, or it may be a problem 
    that affects different types of bells and alarms, or even the possibility 
    that some people may be messing about by ringing doorbells and running away, 
    and other possibilities that we do not deny could happen, but which we also 
    know are contrary to common sense and what usually happens, and they would 
    never occur to any human being unless he is thinking too much about the 
    matter. The mistake he is making is regarding all these possibilities as 
    equal to the common sense principles and regular occurrences which, were it 
    not for them, the sane and the insane would be regarded as equal in this 
    world. Hence the atheist thinks in this crazy way when it comes to thinking 
    about the Creator, but in his daily life he lives in a normal manner, far 
    removed from insanity. So he hastens to open the door after hearing the 
    doorbell ring, to find out who wants to come in, and he doesn’t hesitate for 
    a moment. He does the same thing when the phone rings or any other new 
    development arises: he will definitely look for the cause or for the one who 
    did it.
    Think about how simple an example we gave, that takes only a 
    very brief moment in a man’s life, but contains a great lesson. So how about 
    if we give examples in all affairs of worldly life? If we were to list all 
    regular occurrences in this universe, and the astonishing complexity in 
    their details, and the astounding, miraculous phenomenon of creation that is 
    being unfolded in front of humanity day after day, how could we then forget 
    about all that and forget everything that the Prophets brought and told us 
    about, and go against these givens and rational principles, because of new, 
    rational possibilities and theories, in order to oppose these simple and 
    clear principles and guidelines?

     Would you not agree with us that this is the main problem 
    and that you and people like you do not need to think about the Big Bang 
    theory and so on as much as you need to be rehabilitated so that you may be 
    guided to the sound way in which the individual with a sound, rational mind 
    engages with the universal realities that surround him.
    Shaykh ‘Ali at-Tantaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    All people, believers and disbelievers alike, those who grow 
    up in places of worship and those who grow up in places of evil and 
    promiscuity, when hardship befalls them or some disaster strikes, and they 
    feel distressed as a result and can find no way to cope, do not turn to any 
    of their fellow created beings; rather they turn to the supreme power beyond 
    them, the force that is invisible but which they feel in their souls and in 
    their hearts, and with every nerve in their body they feel its existence and 
    sense its greatness. This happens to many students at the time of exams, and 
    it happens to many sick people when their pain grows worse and the doctor is 
    unable to help. All of them turn back to their Lord and focus on worshipping 
    Him.
    Have you asked yourselves what the reason is in these and 
    similar cases? Why do we find that everyone who goes through hardship turns 
    back to Allah? We all remember the time of the last war, and the one before 
    that, how people used to turn to religion and turn to Allah, and leaders and 
    commanders started going to places of worship and calling upon their troops 
    to pray.
    I read in al-Mukhtaar magazine, in a translation from 
    Reader’s Digest, an article that was published during the war by a young 
    soldier from the parachute regiment (at a time when parachutes were 
    something new). He told his story and said that he had grown up in a house 
    in which there was no one who mentioned God or prayed, and he studied in a 
    school in which there were no classes in religious education and no teacher 
    who was religious. His upbringing was secular and materialistic; in other 
    words he grew up like animals that know nothing but food, drink and sex. But 
    when he jumped for the first time, and found himself falling from the sky, 
    before his parachute opened, he started saying, “O God, O Lord,” calling 
    from his heart. He was surprised and wondered where this faith had come 
    from.
    The daughter of Stalin published her memoirs recently, in 
    which she described how she turned to religion. She had grown up in the 
    depths of atheism, and she surprised herself by returning to religion. But 
    this is not strange, because faith exists in all hearts; it is something 
    natural (instinctive) and is part of original human nature, just like the 
    sexual instinct, because man is a “religious animal”.
    But this instinct may be covered up by desires, hopes and 
    greed, and the pursuit of materialistic things. But once it is shaken by 
    fear, danger or hardship, it emerges. Hence one who does not believe is 
    called a kaafir, which in Arabic means one who conceals.
    It is amazing that I have found this idea supported by the 
    words of two people who are far apart in time, space, circumstances and 
    aims, but these two statements are very close in meaning. These are the 
    words of a well-known, pious Muslim worshipper, Raabi‘ah al-‘Adawiyyah, and 
    the words of a famous French atheist writer, Anatole France.
    Anatole France said, in the context of discussing his own 
    atheism and disbelief: Man believes when his urine test shows that he is 
    diabetic (this was in the days when insulin was as yet unknown).
    It was said to Raabi‘ah: So and so has established one 
    thousand proofs of the existence of Allah. She smiled and said: One proof is 
    sufficient. It was said: What is it? She said: If you were walking on your 
    own in the desert, and you slipped and fell into a well and could not get 
    out of it, what would you do? He said: I would call out: O Allah! She said: 
    That is the proof.
    In the depths of every soul there is faith in God. This is a 
    fact which we Muslims know, because Allah has told us that faith is a 
    natural inclination in people. But the foreigners are rediscovering this. 
    Durkheim, the famous French professor of sociology, wrote a book stating 
    that belief in the existence of God is common sense. Man cannot live or die 
    without thinking that there should be a God for this universe, but his 
    reasoning may fall short, thus he may not be guided to the true God and will 
    worship lesser things, thinking that they are God or that they will bring 
    him closer to God.
    But at times of hardship and moments of danger, he will turn 
    to God alone and ignore these other objects of worship.
    The mushrikeen (polytheists) of Quraysh used to worship Hubal, 
    al-Laat and al-‘Uzza, which were idols made of stone. Hubal was an idol made 
    of rubies that was brought from our land by ‘Amr ibn Lu’ayy, from al-Hammah. 
    They said to him: It is a great and powerful god. So he loaded it onto a 
    camel and brought it, and on the way it fell and its arm was broken. So they 
    made it an arm of gold. This was a god whose arm could be broken, yet they 
    still worshipped it! They worshipped it at times of safety, but when they 
    travelled by sea, and the waves grew high and they were about to drown, they 
    did not say O Hubal; rather they said: O Allah!
    We see this even nowadays, if a ship sinks or a fire breaks 
    out or danger arises or sickness grows severe. You will see atheists turning 
    back to religion. Why is that? It is because faith is instinctual and the 
    best description of the human being is that he is “a religious animal”.
    Look at these materialistic atheists, when death comes to 
    them. Do they think that Marx or Lenin, when death became certain for them, 
    called upon the “means of production” that they deified, or did they call 
    upon God? You can be sure that they did not die before they called upon God, 
    but that was at a time when such supplication was of no benefit. Pharaoh was 
    an arrogant tyrant, who said, “I am your lord most high,” but when he was 
    about to drown, he said, “I believe in the One in whom the Children of 
    Israel believe.”

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/208/innovations-in-religion-and-worship,"There is a silsila of sufiya based in Pakistan. They recite the verse o those who believe remember Allah and make zikr e kaseer ' (surah noor ). And the ayat ' And remember ( O prophet ) your lord in your nafs , with humility and fear , and without raising your voice ; remember Him in the evening and morning and do not become those who are negligent ' ( 8:205 ) . They say this ayat makes it farz to remember allah 24 hours daily with not a second wasted and this zikr is to be done in heart. For this purpose hasan basri r.h made a way to do meditation and practice saying "" Allah hu "" with particular control on your breath. And they say it is said in quran and hadees that every body part of the companions made constant zikr. We ask is it obligatory to make our hearts recite name of allah 24 hours daily. What is zikr e kaseer? Is this method ok and did hasan basri r.h made this way of zikr? What do the ayats mean.?","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:
	Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
	meaning):

	“O you who 
	believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance.

	And glorify His Praises morning and afternoon (the early 
	morning (Fajr) and Asr prayers)”

	[al-Ahzaab 33:41, 42].
	Here Allah, may He be exalted, instructs the believers to 
	remember Him with much remembrance, such as tahleel (saying “Laa ilaaha 
	ill-Allah (There is no god but Allah)”), [email protected] (saying “al-hamdu 
	Lillah (praise be to Allah)”), 
	tasbeeh (saying “Subhaan 
	Allah (glory be to Allah)”), takbeer 
	(saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”), and other words that bring 
	one closer to Allah.
	The minimum of that is regularly reciting the dhikr for 
	morning and afternoon, following the five obligatory prayers, and on various 
	occasions when there are reasons to recite dhikr.
	One should persist in doing that at all times and in all 
	situations, by virtue of which the doer may advance without much effort, for 
	that will motivate him to love and know Allah, and it will help him to do 
	good and will restrain his tongue from evil speech.
	“And glorify His Praises morning and afternoon” that 
	is, at the beginning and end of the day, because these are virtuous times 
	and it is easy to do this at those times.
	Tafseer as-Sa‘di 
	(p. 65)
	Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
	meaning):

	“and remember 
	Allah much, that you may be successful”

	[al-Jumu‘ah 62:10].
	Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	That is, when you are buying and selling, giving and taking, 
	remember Allah much, and do not let this world distract you from that which 
	will benefit you in the Hereafter. End quote.
	Tafseer Ibn Katheer 
	(8/1 23)
	And Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
	meaning):

	“Verily, the 
	Muslims (those who submit to Allah in Islam) men and women, the believers 
	men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who 
	are obedient (to Allah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech 
	and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the 
	duties which Allah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allah has 
	forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord Allah), 
	the men and the women who give Sadaqat (i.e. Zakat, and alms, etc.), the men 
	and the women who observe Saum (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the 
	month of Ramadan, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women 
	who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the 
	women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues (while sitting, 
	standing, lying, etc. for more than 300 times extra over the remembrance of 
	Allah during the five compulsory congregational prayers) or praying extra 
	additional Nawafil prayers of night in the last part of night, etc.) Allah 
	has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)”

	[al-Ahzaab 33:35].
	An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	It should be understood that this verse is something of which 
	the author of this book (i.e., his book al-Adhkaar) is interested in 
	understanding the meaning.
	There was a difference of opinion concerning that. Imam 
	Abu’l-Hasan al-Waahidi said: Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) 
	said: What is meant is that they should remember Allah following the 
	prayers, morning and afternoon, and when they go to bed, and whenever they 
	wake up from sleep, and whenever a person leaves home and comes back he 
	should remember Allah, may He be exalted.

	Mujaahid said: A person will never be one of the men and 
	women who remember Allah, may He be exalted, much until he remembers Allah, 
	may He be exalted, standing, sitting and lying down.
	‘Ata’ said: Whoever offers the five daily prayers properly is 
	included in the words of Allah, may He be exalted: “the 
	men and the women who remember Allah much”.
	Abu ‘Amr ibn as-Salaah (may Allah have mercy on him) was 
	asked about the amount by which a person may become one of the men and women 
	who remember Allah much.
	He said: If he regularly recites the proven narrated adhkaar, 
	morning and evening, and at various times and in various situations, night 
	and day. Al-Adhkaar (p. 41)
	There is nothing in these verses – or elsewhere – to indicate 
	that it is obligatory to remember Allah, may He be exalted, at every moment 
	and every second, because this is something that hardly any human being can 
	do, and Allah has never obliged His slaves to do that. It is not Islam that 
	teaches or enjoins that.
	If you search all the books of the scholars, whether the 
	books of the fuqaha’, mufassireen (commentators of the Qur’an) and 
	muhadditheen (hadith scholars), you will not find in those books that this 
	is attributed to the religion of Allah.
	Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (2702) from al-Agharr 
	al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: 
	“There is some kind of shadow upon my 
	heart, so I ask Allah for forgiveness one hundred times a day.”.
	An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh:
	The linguists said that what is meant here is that which 
	covers the heart. Al-Qaadi said: It was said that what is meant is when he 
	grew tired or neglected or forgot the remembrance of Allah that he did 
	constantly. If he tired of it or neglected it, he regarded that as a sin, 
	and sought forgiveness for it. End quote.
	Thirdly:
	With regard to what these people say about every body part of 
	the Companions remembering Allah, and so on, all of that comes under the 
	heading of exaggeration and falsehood, for which there is no basis in any 
	history or report. Their biographies and stories are available to people, so 
	where would the reader find these notions, except in the claims of these 
	people and other extremists of their ilk?

	Yes, they were the best of people, and the best generation 
	among whom a Prophet was sent, but they were also people like others, who 
	ate, drank, bought, sold, mixed with their wives and children…  They even 
	disagreed and disputed!
	Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (2750) that Hanzalah al-Usaydi 
	(may Allah be pleased with him), who was one of the scribes of the Messenger 
	of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: 

	Abu Bakr met me and said: How are you, O Hanzalah? 
	

	I said: Hanzalah has become a hypocrite. 

	He said: Subhaan Allah! What are you saying? 
	

	I said: When we are with the Messenger of Allah (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him) he reminds us of the Fire and the Garden 
	until it is as if we are seeing them with our own eyes, but when we depart 
	from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we 
	attend to our wives and children and businesses, and we forget a great deal.
	

	Abu Bakr said: By Allah, we experience something similar.
	

	Abu Bakr and I went and entered upon the Messenger of Allah 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).

	I said: Hanzalah has become a hypocrite, O Messenger of 
	Allah. 

	The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) said: “Why is that?” 

	I said: O Messenger of Allah, when we are with you, you 
	remind us of the Fire and the Garden until it is as if we are seeing them 
	with our own eyes, but when we depart from you, we attend to our wives and 
	children and businesses, and we forget a great deal. 

	The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) said: 

	“By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if you continued as you 
	are when you are with me, and continued to remember (Paradise and Hell), the 
	angels would shake hands with you in your homes and on the streets. But, O 
	Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that” (he said it) three 
	times..
	Al-Qurtubi said:
	The words of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), “By 
	Allah, we experience something similar” offer a refutation of the extreme 
	Sufis who claim to be constantly in such a state, and that because of it 
	they would not go and check on their families or property.
	The refutation is to be found in the fact that Abu Bakr was 
	the best of all people after the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of 
	Allah be upon him) until the Day of Resurrection, yet despite that, he did 
	not claim to be different from other humans or to be in a state of constant 
	remembrance of Allah and never tire of it, which is something that applies 
	only to the angels.
	Some people claim to be constantly in a state of dhikr 
	(remembrance of Allah), but, we have mentioned above, is virtually 
	impossible.
	To sum up, Allah has ordained that human wellbeing is connected to changes in their condition and their means of drawing close to Allah is connected to their striving and efforts.

	The reason for that is that this world is in between the 
	world of the angels and the world of the devils, so He enables the angels to 
	do good in the sense that they do what they are commanded to do, and they 
	glorify Him night and day, and never tire of doing so. And he enables the 
	devils to do evil and tempt people and never slacken. But He has caused this 
	human world to vary, so that He may enable a person to be in one situation 
	then cause it to change to another, and cause him to live then die, and 
	cause him to find and lose. This was referred to by the one who will 
	intercede (namely the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), 
	who said: “But, O Hanzalah, there is a time for this and a time for that.” 
	And according to the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) he 
	said: “The wise man should have certain times: a time when he converses with 
	his Lord, a time when he takes stock of himself, a time when he reflects 
	upon the creation of Allah, and a time when he attends to his need for food 
	and drink.”
	This is the way of perfections, and all others are nonsense 
	and based on illusion.
	End quote from al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhees Kitaab 
	Muslim by al-Qurtubi (7/67-68)
	Something similar may be said about the false story that they 
	narrated in which they claimed that al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy 
	on him) had a special way of remembering Allah with every breath; there is 
	no proof of that and no basis for it as far as we know.
	Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) is one of 
	those concerning whom fabrications were made up by the ignorant Sufis and 
	ascetics. They attribute to him things that have not been soundly narrated 
	from him; in fact no source is known for them.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/23/schools-of-thought-and-sects,Is the book Bihaar al-Anwaar sound and are its reports soundly narrated? Is Tafseer al-Jalaalayn by Imam as-Suyooti a sound and trustworthy book? Is Imam as-Suyooti one of the scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah?,"Praise
      be to Allah.

    
    Firstly:
    
    The book Bihaar al-Anwaar by Muhammad Baaqir al-Majlisi is one of the 
    books of the Raafidi Shi‘ah. In fact it is an ocean (bihaar) filled 
    with fabrications and misguidance for which there is no known basis or 
    foundation, apart from the false, innovated religion of the Raafidis.
    
    Secondly:
    
    With regard to Tafseer al-Jalaalayn (by Jalaal ad-Deen as-Suyooti and 
    Jalaal ad-Deen al-Muhalli), it is a good tafseer and summary, but it is not 
    free of some shortcomings, especially with regard to the attributes of Allah 
    and matters of ‘aqeedah (belief), in which it follows the madhhab of the 
    Ash‘aris. In that regard you may benefit from reading the book Anwaar al-Hilaalayn 
    fi at-Ta‘aqqubaat ‘ala al-Jalaalayn, by Dr. Muhammad ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Khamees.
    
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about that and he said: It is a useful tafseer, 
    although it contains some errors regarding the divine attributes… There is 
    hardly any book that is free of errors, except the Book of Allah. Books 
    written by people usually contain some errors, but some have fewer errors 
    than others. Tafseer al-Jalaalayn contains some errors, so if it is 
    possible to be taught it by one who has knowledge of the Sunnah and knows 
    the views of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah, and he can alert his students to 
    the mistakes, that is good. If a student does not understand something, he 
    should ask the scholars.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/258/psychological-and-social-problems,"I always try to be the best Muslim I can. I pray, I fast, I recite Quran as much as I can etc. I am 16 years old and at this age a boy's sperm (mani) comes out a lot. It comes out in one way or another, like masturbation by hand, or dreams and such (this happens once or twice a week, if it doesn't come out in other ways). Now, in dreams one dreams of a tempting girl. As I said, I try to be a good Muslim and I don't look at the beauty of women (because it is haram), and I look and see and speak only to my hamrams (without lust, of course). One of them is my sister, and she is a beautiful young lady and attractive. I see her every day because we are brother and sister. I dream about her in my sleep, and this makes me sick and I don't know how to get rid of this. She is with me in the same house and I can't prevent the dreams because the mani must come out as a result of them. I am trying to find solutions and I will be grateful if to you if you could help me in this matter. I have found two solutions, but they are haram, however they are better than  dreaming about your sister. One: I look at women like an actress or someone similar whom I am attracted by, so that will take the place of my sister in the dreams. Id that ok? If not, why? I am sure this is better than seeing my sister in my dream. Second: I masturbate using my hand, without imagining anyone in particular or picturing naything in my mind; just once to release the mani by masturbating (this means I will get rid of the dreams as much as possible). I know that masturbation is haram, but I find it better than dreaming about my sister, and that is truly uncomfortable. Is this a test from Allah. Please inform me which of the two I should do. If the response is no, then what should I do? Please respond quickly.","Praise be to Allah
Firstly:
By the grace of Allah, may He be exalted, towards you, He has enabled you at this age to worship Him and obey Him. By His grace towards you, He has blessed you with the ability to rebuke yourself when you fall short in obeying Him, and when you do something that it is not appropriate for you to do. These blessings from the Lord, may He be exalted, require you to give thanks in your heart, in your words and in your deeds, especially when you see young people around you of a similar age who go with the flow of lust and are drowning in a sea of misguidance and deviation.
Secondly:
You must understand that wet dreams happen to both women and men, single people and married people. They may happen to one who recites adhkaar before sleeping and to one who does not do that. There is no sin on a person for what he sees in his dreams, because he does not have any control over it or any ability to ward it off. The Muslim is not accountable for such things, just as he will not be rewarded for what he does in his dreams of acts of obedience and worship. There is a saheeh hadith from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which states that the Pen of accountability is lifted from “the sleeper until he wakes up.”
So you should not feel anxious about what you see in your dreams. What you should worry about and be concerned about is what you do when you are awake, and this is what you suggested as a remedy for the problem of having wet dreams about your sister. Both of your suggestions are haraam and it is not permissible for you to do them. It is not permissible to look at pictures of actresses, singers and other attractive girls. For information on the prohibition on doing that, please see the answer to question no. 1774. Similarly, it is not permissible to engage in the secret habit (masturbation). For information on the prohibition on doing that, please see the answer to question no. 329. In addition to both actions being haraam, they will never avail you anything, and they will never prevent you from having wet dreams. We mentioned above that wet dreams happen even to married people and those who fulfil their desires in permissible ways.
You should understand that looking at your sister with desire is emphatically forbidden. In addition to being forbidden, it also has a strong connection to what you see in your dreams. It is well-known that some of what is seen in dreams is the outcome of the thoughts that the person thinks when he is awake. This means that looking at your sister – or any other woman – in haraam ways and thinking about sex before going to sleep may lead to seeing that in your dream. Hence the advice of the scholars to one who is faced with this problem is to purify himself [do wudoo’] before sleeping, recite Aayat al-Kursiy, and stop thinking about sex and desire. If, after that, he sees something in his dream that he dislikes, he should not blame himself if no heedlessness occurred whilst he was awake. So pay attention to this, and bear it in mind.
Among the things stated by those who specialise in dream interpretation is that wet dreams like those that you see come from the Shaytaan, in order to make it easier for you to commit shameful deeds whilst awake. This is a serious matter to which you should pay attention, for the Shaytaan may also toy with the other party, and show her something similar to what you see in your dreams, for the same purpose. This is completely in accordance with those who say that the Shaytaan has something to do with wet dreams, and there is a great difference between the one who sees himself in his dream committing shameful deeds with his sister,  although he is chaste and decent in his dealings with her when he is awake, and the one who sees such dreams, and looks at her with desire when he is awake. The former is the one who is fearful and anxious about his dreams, and he is unlikely to do such a thing in reality, in contrast to the one who is tempted when he is awake, so the Shaytaan does not leave him alone when he is asleep, just as he did not leave him alone when he was awake.
Thirdly:
Some specialist doctors have stated that a person may do something when he is awake that will cause him to have a wet dream when he goes to sleep, although it should be noted that there is a difference of opinion among scholars concerning the cause of this phenomenon. That includes looking at women in unlawful ways, thinking about sex and desire, not urinating before going to sleep, and filling the stomach with food. We hope that you will avoid all of these things, and go to sleep in a state of purity and after reciting dhikr, so that you can rid yourself of these dreams which are causing you anxiety.
Fourthly:
The ultimate solution to your problem is to get married. If you are not able to do that, then you should fast, because fasting purifies the soul and leads to taqwa (mindfulness of Allah), which will help to prevent you from doing haraam things. Both of these are the recommendation of your Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to young people like you.
It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and we could not afford to get married. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it should fast, for it will be a shield for him.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4779) and Muslim (1400).
See the answer to question no. 9208, where we explained that wet dreams are something natural for which a person is not to be blamed. You can also refer to question no. 20229, which discusses means that will help you to lower your gaze; and question no. 20161, which discusses the solution to the problem of desire and how to control it. In the answer to question no. 39768, we discussed the health implications of the secret habit for the body, mind, face and memory, and we discuss ways of giving up this habit and avoiding falling into it.
Fifthly:
If you are suffering from this problem, and the Shaytaan is filling your mind with such thoughts about your sister, then you should take precautions to protect yourself. So you should avoid looking at her or being alone with her, for she is your sister. Tell her not to be careless in the way she dresses in front of you, for mahrams are not all the same when it comes to the ruling on showing adornment in front of them. A woman may show all of her adornment to her husband, but when it comes to other mahrams, such as her father, brother and the like, she should not show in front of them anything but that which ordinarily appears of her, such as the forearm, neck and so on. This is a basic ruling, regardless of problems that may arise, such as your problem.
But when a problem does arise, such as the problem that you are talking about, then precautions should be more stringent and covering should be more complete. But you should not draw her attention to anything that is crossing your mind. Rather you should try to guide her to do that through your parents, if possible, without giving any indication of what is going on in your mind or of what you see in your dreams.
The great scholar Ibn al-Qattaan (may Allah have mercy on him) said in an-Nazr fi Ahkaam an-Nazr (312):
Question: He may only see of her – meaning his mahram – her face, hands and feet, whether she is young or old. That is permissible, with no difference of scholarly opinion, because it is something that ordinarily appears (when at home), unless he looks at those parts of his mahram with desire. There is no doubt that this is haraam, and I think that there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr stated that it is prohibited, and he did not narrate any different view concerning it.
End quote.
Abu Bakr al-Hasani ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Kifaayat al-Akhyaar (1/460:
It is haraam to look at mahrams with desire, and there is no scholarly difference of opinion concerning that. End quote.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/126/pilgrimage,"More than five years ago, myself, my mother, my father and my brother went to do ‘umrah. When we entered the Haram, my father said: I am going to pray ‘Isha’. He and my brother went, and my mother and I waited, and he disappeared for two hours or more – I do not remember – but we got tired of waiting for them, and my mother feared for them, and we did not have cell phones with us. I do not know how to do ‘umrah. Finally my father came, but we were utterly exhausted because of the severe crowding. We said to my father: Where were you? He said: I did ‘umrah; why didn’t you do ‘umrah? We said: We were waiting for you, and we did not know that you wanted us to do ‘umrah, because you did not tell us. My father got angry because he was tired, as we had come from al-Qasim. We went to my mother’s family in Makkah and we did not do ‘umrah. What is the ruling on that, and what must we do? Also, at that time I was studying in high school, and because I was utterly tired and distressed because of the crowding and the women bumping into me, I got angry and I swore that I would not do ‘umrah until I was forty years old. Now I want to do ‘umrah, so what should I do?","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:

	One of the 
	mistakes that some people make is not asking about something that happened 
	until a long time has passed, which is indicative of heedlessness, because 
	what they should do is hasten to ask so that they can make up for whatever 
	can be made up.

	Secondly:

	Whoever enters 
	ihram for either Hajj or ‘umrah must complete it, and it is not permissible 
	for him to interrupt that ritual before completing it, because Allah, may He 
	be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

	“And 
	perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet 
	Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), the Hajj and Umrah 
	(i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah”

	[al-Baqarah 
	2:196].
	

	What you and 
	your mother should have done during that time was perform ‘umrah, and you 
	should not have obeyed your father by abandoning ‘umrah.

	Based on that, 
	what you must do now is go back to Makkah to complete ‘umrah by doing tawaaf 
	and sa‘i, and cutting your hair. Thus you will exit ihram for ‘umrah.

	You must also 
	avoid the things that are prohibited whilst in ihram, such as wearing 
	perfume, cutting your hair and nails, wearing gloves and niqab, entering 
	into a marriage contract, or having intercourse and doing the things that 
	lead to it.

	If it so happens 
	that you have done any of these prohibited things out of ignorance or 
	because you forgot, then you do not have to do anything further.

	As for the one 
	who falls short in asking, or knows that he must do something but does not 
	enquire as to what exactly it is, or he knows that he made a mistake by 
	failing to complete ‘umrah and that he was obliged to complete it but did 
	not do that, then he must pay a penalty for each of the things that are 
	prohibited in ihram that he committed, before he completes the ‘umrah that 
	he started and exits ihram from it in the proper manner. For more 
	information, please see the answer to question no. 
	104178.

	If you got 
	married during this period, then you must repeat the marriage contract with 
	your husband; so your guardian must do a new marriage contract for you with 
	your husband, in the presence of two witnesses, because you were in a state 
	of ihram and that remains in effect until you do ‘umrah and complete it.
	

	See the answer 
	to question no. 176422

	Thirdly: 
	

	With regard to 
	your saying “I swore that I would not do ‘umrah until I was forty years old” 
	this does not include the ‘umrah that you did not complete, because that 
	happened before you swore the oath.

	But if you want 
	to do ‘umrah again before you reach the age of forty, then in this case you 
	must offer expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen), because the 
	Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an 
	oath then sees that something else is better than it, let him do that and 
	offer expiation for his oath.”

	Narrated by 
	Muslim (1650)

	You should not 
	let that oath prevent you from doing an act of obedience to Allah, and you 
	should discipline yourself to refrain from doing such a thing in the future. 
	It is not wise or sensible at all for a Muslim to let his anger make him do 
	such things, for he may swear an oath or say something or do something out 
	of anger, then regret it after that, when it is too late and it is not 
	possible to make up for what he did.

	And Allah knows 
	best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/213/love-of-allaah,"I am a man and I never cry. How can I make my eyes weep for fear of Allah in accordance with the hadeeth: “Two eyes that will never be touched by the Fire” in which it mentions “The eye that weeps for fear of Allah”? 

May Allah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah

    Undoubtedly your feelings of regret for 
    missing out on this blessing is a very good sign. You should note that the 
    Muslim can accustom himself to weep for fear of Allah, by doing the 
    following:
    1 – Making yourself feel fear of Allah.
    This weeping is the fruit of beneficial 
    knowledge, as al-Qurtubi says in his commentary on the verse (interpretation 
    of the meaning):
    “And they fall down on their faces 
    weeping” [17:109] 
This 
    is an eloquent description of them and praise for them. It is the duty of 
    everyone who acquires knowledge to reach this level, so that when he hears 
    the Quran he is filled with fear and humility. In Musnad al-Daarimi it is 
    narrated from Abu Muhammad that al-Taymi said: Whoever is given knowledge 
    and does not weep, he deserves not to have any knowledge, because Allah has 
    described those who have knowledge; then he recited this verse.
    Al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam il-Qur’aan, 
    10/341-342.
    2 – Reading the Quran and pondering its 
    meanings
    Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):
    “Say (O Muhammad to them): Believe in it 
    (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given 
    knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in 
    humble prostration.

    And they say: Glory be to our Lord! Truly, 
    the Promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.

    And they fall down on their faces weeping 
    and it increases their humility” 
    [17:107-109]
    “Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed 
    His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those 
    whom We carried (in the ship) with Nooh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and 
    Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the Verses of 
    the Most Gracious (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate 
    and weeping” [19:58]

     It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah 
    be upon him) said to me: “Recite the Quran to me.” I said: “O Messenger of 
    Allah, shall I recite it to you when it was revealed to you?” He said: “I 
    like to hear it from someone else.” So I recited Soorat al-Nisa’ to him, and 
    when I reached this verse – “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each 
    nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these 
    people?” [4:41] – he said: “That is enough for now.” I turned to him and saw 
    his eyes were streaming with tears. Narrated by al-Bukhari andMuslim.
    3 – Knowing the greatness of the reward 
    for weeping, especially when one is alone.
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah said: “A man who 
    weeps for fear of Allah will not enter Hell until the milk goes back into 
    the udder, and dust produced (when fighting) for the sake of Allah and the 
    smoke of Hell will never coexist.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasaa’i.

    “until the milk goes back into the udder” 
    is a metaphor for it being impossible, as in the verse where Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “and they will not enter Paradise until the 
    camel goes through the eye of the needle” [7:40]. Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
And it 
    was narrated that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) said: “There are seven whom Allah will shade with His 
    shade on the day when there will be no shade but His: a just ruler; a young 
    man who grows up worshipping Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the 
    mosque; two people who love one another for the sake of Allah, meeting and 
    parting on that basis; a man who is called (to commit sin) by a woman of 
    high status and great beauty and he says, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in 
    charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand is 
    doing; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone and his eyes flow with 
    tears.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
    Weeping when alone is singled out because 
    being alone is a time when the heart tends to become harder and there is a 
    stronger motive to commit sin, and it is farthest removed from the 
    possibility of showing off. So if a person strives to do this, and makes 
    himself feel the greatness and might of Allah, and his eyes flow with tears, 
    then he deserves to be beneath the shade of the Throne of the Most Merciful 
    on the Day when there will be no shade but His shade.
    4 – Thinking about your situation and your 
    boldness in committing sin, and fearing to meet Allah in such a state.
    One of the righteous people used to weep 
    night and day, and something was said to him about that. He said: “I am 
    afraid that Allah will see me committing sin and will say: ‘Go away from Me 
    for I am angry with you.’” Hence Sufyan used to weep and say: “I am afraid 
    that my faith will be taken away at the moment of death.”
    Isma’il ibn Zakariya described Habeeb ibn 
    Muhammad, who was a neighbour of his. He said: “Every evening I heard him 
    weeping and every morning I heard him weeping, so I went to his wife and 
    said: ‘What is the matter with him? He weeps in the evening and he weeps in 
    the morning!’ She said to me: ‘By Allah, when evening comes he fears that he 
    will not live till morning and when morning comes he fears that he will not 
    live till evening.’”
    The salaf (righteous predecessors) used to 
    weep and grieve a great deal. When Yazeed al-Raqaashi was criticized for 
    weeping a great deal and it was said to him, “If the Fire had been created 
    exclusively for you, you would not weep more than this,” he said: “Has the 
    Fire been created for anyone other than me and my companions and brothers 
    among the jinn and mankind?”
    When ‘Ata’ al-Sulaymi was asked: “What is 
    this grief?” he said: “Woe to you! Death is close at hand, the grave is my 
    house, on the Day of Resurrection I will stand and my path is over a bridge 
    across Hell, and I do not know what will become of me.”
    Faddalah ibn Sayfi used to weep a great 
    deal. A man entered upon him when he was weeping and said to his wife: “What 
    is the matter with him?” She said: “He says that he wants to undertake a 
    long journey and he does not have proper provision for it.”
    One night al-Hasan woke up weeping, and he 
    disturbed the other people in the house with his weeping. They asked him 
    what was the matter and he said: “I remembered a sin that I committed and I 
    wept.”
    It was narrated that Tameem al-Daari (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) recited this verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them 
    equal with those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah- Islamic Monotheism) 
    and do righteous good deeds” [45:21] and he started repeating it and weeping 
    until morning came.
    Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) used to weep intensely, and it was 
    said to him: “Why are you weeping?” He said: “I do not know what is ahead of 
    me – Divine pleasure or divine wrath.” 
    Sa’d ibn al-Akhram said: I was walking 
    with Ibn Mas’ood and he passed by the blacksmiths, who had brought a piece 
    of iron out of the fire. He stood and looked at the molten iron and wept.
    5 – Making yourself feel regret and 
    feeling that you have fallen short in your duties towards Allah. 
    The tears of the repentant at night 
    quenches thirst and cures sickness, as the Shaykh of the Mufassireen (exegetists), 
    Abu Ja’far al-Tabari, said in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of 
    the meaning):
    “Do you then wonder at this recitation 
    (the Quran)?

    And you laugh at it and weep not”
    [53:59-60] 
Do not 
    weep at the warnings contained therein to those who disobey Allah, when you 
    are people who commit sin, “Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and 
    amusements (singing)” [53:61] – you are heedless of the lessons and 
    reminders contained therein, turning away from its verses. 
Jaami’ 
    al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi al-Qur’aan, 27/82. 
6 – 
    Weeping out of fear of a bad end. 
It was 
    narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by al-Hijr 
    (the land of the people of Thamood) he said: “Do not enter the dwellings of 
    those who wronged themselves, lest what befell them befall you, unless you 
    are weeping.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) covered his head and walked quickly until he had left the valley. 
    Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. 
Al-Nawawi 
    included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled “Weeping and feeling fear when 
    passing by the graves of the wrongdoers and the places where they were 
    killed, and expressing one's need of Allah, and being careful not to be 
    negligent in that.” Riyadh al-Saliheen. 
7 – 
    Listening to moving speeches and lectures that will soften the heart. 
It was 
    narrated that al-‘Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him), who was 
    one of those who used to weep, said: “The Messenger of Allah delivered a 
    deeply moving speech at which our eyes began to overflow and our hearts 
    melted.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood and Ibn Maajah. 
May Allah help us and you to do that which our Lord loves and is pleased with him."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/218/supplication,"How sound is this hadith: “O Allah, Who relieves worry and distress, Who answers the call of the desperate, Most Gracious and Most Merciful in this world and the hereafter, You are the One Who could bestow mercy on me, so bestow mercy on me, so that I will have no need of mercy from anyone else”?","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:

	The text of this supplication appears in two hadiths.

	-1-

	In a hadith narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased 
	with her):

	Abu Bakr came in and said: Did you hear from the Messenger of 
	Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a supplication that he 
	taught me? I said: What is it? He said: ‘Eesa ibn Maryam used to teach it to 
	his companions. He said: If one of you owed a debt worth a mountain of gold, 
	and called upon Allah with these words, Allah would pay it off for him: “O 
	Allah, Who relieves worry and distress, Who answers the call of the 
	desperate, Most Gracious and Most Merciful in this world and the hereafter, 
	You are the One Who could bestow mercy on me, so bestow mercy on me, so that 
	I will have no need of mercy from anyone else.”

	Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I 
	had an outstanding debt, and I hated being in debt, so I used to offer 
	supplication in these words, then Allah granted me some wealth and paid off 
	my debt for me.

	‘Aa’ishah said: I owed Asma’ bint ‘Umays a dinar and three 
	dirhams, and she would come to see me and I would feel too shy to look her 
	in the face, because I could not afford to pay her back. I used to offer 
	supplication in these words, and shortly afterwards Allah granted me some 
	provision that was not in the form of charity that someone gave me or in the 
	form of inheritance that I inherited. Thus Allah paid it off on my behalf, 
	and I shared out some of that wealth with my family, and I bought some 
	jewellery for the daughter of ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan, three uqiyahs of silver, and 
	there was some left over for us.

	This was narrated by al-Bazaar, as was attributed to him by 
	as-Suyooti in ad-Durar al-Manthoor (1/24); Abu Bakr al-Marwazi in Musnad 
	Abi Bakr as-Siddeeq (no. 40); at-Tabaraani in ad-Du‘aa’ (1/317); Ibn 
	‘Adiyy in al-Kaamil (2/203) and via him by Ibn ‘Asaakir in 
	Taareekh Dimashq (47/472). It was narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak 
	(1/696); al-Bayhaqi in Dalaa’il an-Nubuwwah (no. 2420), in ad-Da‘waat 
	al-Kabeer (no. 167) and in Musnad al-Firdaws by ad-Daylami (no. 
	1988).

	It was narrated by a number of chains of narration from 
	Yoonus ibn Yazeed al-Ayli, from al-Hakam ibn ‘Abdillah al-Ayli, from al-Qaasim 
	ibn Muhammad, from ‘Aa’ishah.

	Al-Haakim said: This is a saheeh hadith, but al-Bukhaari and 
	Muslim did not regard al-Hakam ibn ‘Abdillah al-Ayli as a sound narrator. 
	End quote.

	However, the correct view is that al-Hakam ibn ‘Abdillah al-Ayli 
	is a very weak (da‘eef jiddan) narrator of hadith, and more than one of the 
	leading scholars regarded him as a liar. It says in his biography in 
	Lisaan al-Mizaan (2/332): Ibn al-Mubaarak used to criticise him harshly. 
	Ahmad said: His hadiths are all fabricated (mawdoo‘). Ibn Ma‘een said: He is 
	not trustworthy; as-Sa‘di and Abu Haatim said: He is a liar. An-Nasaa’i, ad-Daaraqutni 
	and a number of others said: His hadith is to be rejected.

	Al-Bukhaari said: 

	They rejected his hadith. Ibn al-Mubaarak regarded him as 
	insignificant and, according to one report, classed him as da‘eef (weak). 
	Muslim said in al-Kunaa: His hadith is munkar (odd). End quote. Many 
	scholars condemned his hadith.

	Thus it becomes clear that the hadith is odd (munkar) or 
	fabricated (mawdoo‘), in contrast to the view of Imam al-Haakim (may Allah 
	have mercy on him). Hence Imam al-Mundhiri classed it as da‘eef in at-Targheeb 
	wa’t-Tarheeb (3/57). He also mentioned another fault, which is that al-Qaasim 
	did not hear from ‘Aa’ishah. It was also classed as da‘eef by Imam as-Suyooti 
	in ad-Durr al-Manthoor (1/24). In Da‘eef at-Targheeb (1143), 
	Shaykh al-Albaani classed it as fabricated (mawdoo‘).

	-2-

	It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:

	“O ‘Ali, shall I not teach you a supplication which, if you 
	are afflicted by worry and distress and you call upon your Lord with these 
	words, you will receive a response by Allah’s leave, and be granted relief? 
	Do wudoo’ and pray two rak‘ahs, praise and glorify Allah, send blessings 
	upon your Prophet, and seek forgiveness for yourself and for the believing 
	men and women, then say: ‘O Allah, You judge between Your slaves regarding 
	that wherein they differ. There is no god but Allah, the Most High, the Most 
	Great; there is no god but Allah, the Most Forbearing, the Most Generous; 
	glory be to Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Mighty Throne; 
	praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah, Who relieves worry and 
	distress, Who answers the call of the desperate, Most Gracious and Most 
	Merciful in this world and the hereafter, You are the One Who could bestow 
	mercy on me, so bestow mercy on me, so that I will have no need of mercy 
	from anyone else.”

	Shaykh al-Albaani said in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah (no. 
	5287):

	It is munkar (odd). It was narrated by al-Asbahaani 
	(2/534/1278) from Ishaaq ibn al-Fayd: al-Mada’ told us: ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn 
	Anas told me, attributing it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
	upon him)…

	I – Shaykh al-Albaani – say: This is a shady (muzlim), weak (da‘eef) 
	isnad… Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed its faults in detail. 
	See the reference in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah mentioned above. 
	

	To sum up, the text of this supplication is not narrated via 
	any sound chain of narration; rather all its chains are very weak. Therefore 
	the scholars deemed it to be fabricated and narrated it in the books of 
	fabricated reports (al-mawdoo‘aat), such as Tadhkirat al-Mawdoo‘aat 
	by al-Fatani (p. 53); Tanzeeh ash-Sharee‘ah (2/333) and al-Fawaa’id 
	al-Majmoo‘ah (p. 59, 52).

	Secondly:

	There is nothing wrong with a person making this part of his 
	supplication, or asking Allah for what he needs in these words, because they 
	are all phrases that are sound in meaning and for which there is a great 
	deal of evidence in the Qur’an and saheeh Sunnah. It contains meanings of 
	humility, seeking to draw close to Allah, showing submission before Allah, 
	the Lord of the Worlds. It also demonstrates seeking to draw close to Allah 
	by virtue of the attributes of Allah, may He be exalted, and His mercy which 
	encompasses all things. So whoever says these words in supplication – 
	without believing that it has any extra virtue or brings any special reward 
	– it is hoped that it will be accepted and answered.

	It was narrated that ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Saabit said:

	The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) used to offer supplication in these words, and show respect for the 
	words: “O Allah, Who relieves worry and distress, Who answers the call of 
	the desperate, Most Gracious and Most Merciful in this world and the 
	hereafter, You are the One Who could bestow mercy on me, so bestow mercy on 
	me, so that I will have no need of mercy from anyone else.” 
	

	Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf (6/109) 
	with a saheeh isnad from ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Saabit. But this ‘Abd 
	ar-Rahmaan was one of the Taabi‘een and did not meet the Prophet (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him), as is stated in his biography in 
	Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (6/181). So his hadith is mursal, but mursal 
	hadiths may be valid as references regarding dhikr and du‘aa’. In fact, if 
	the meanings and wording of a supplication (du‘aa’) is sound, it is 
	permissible to say these words in supplication, even if the ywere not 
	originally narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him), for the door of supplication is open to anyone who strives hard in it. 
	However, the supplications that are narrated and proven bring greater 
	blessing and are sound in meaning, and they are furthest removed from using 
	complex phrases or overstepping the mark in supplication.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/192/food-nourishment,"We live in a Shi‘i community, and you are aware of the beliefs of the Shi‘ah that are contrary to the Qur’an and Sunnah, despite the fact that they claim to be Muslims. Is it permissible for us to eat meat slaughtered by them, over which they mention the name of Allah when slaughtering – for sale in the marketplaces – but their real intention is to slaughter it in honour of graves or the dead or the shrines, or in fulfilment of vows (to the dead, etc)?","Praise be to Allah.
One of the 
      conditions of meat being halaal is that the one who slaughters it must be 
      a Muslim or a kitaabi (i.e., a Jew or a Christian). Hence meat slaughtered 
      by a mushrik, Zoroastrian or apostate is not permissible and is not 
      halaal. 
The Shi‘ah have a 
    number of beliefs and actions that put them beyond the pale of Islam, such 
    as their belief that the Holy Qur’an has been distorted, and that their 
    Imams have knowledge of the unseen, and are infallible and cannot be 
    heedless or forget. 
They seek the help of 
    the dead and call upon them instead of Allah; they prostrate towards their 
    graves; and they revile the best of mankind after the Prophets and 
    Messengers, namely the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him), and regard them as disbelievers. This has been discussed 
    previously in the answers to questions no. 1148,
    10272 and 21500. 
Whoever believes in 
    any of these things, or does any of these acts that constitute kufr 
    (disbelief) has gone beyond the pale of Islam, and meat slaughtered by him 
    is not halaal. 
The scholars of the 
    Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about eating meat 
    slaughtered by the Ja‘fari Shi‘ah, knowing that they call upon ‘Ali, 
    al-Hasan, al-Husayn and all their leaders, at times of hardship and of 
    ease. 
They replied: 
if the matter is as 
    the questioner said, that the group that he is referring to are Ja‘faris who 
    call upon ‘Ali, al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and their leaders, then they are 
    mushrikeen and apostates from Islam – Allah forbid – and it is not 
    permissible to eat meat slaughtered by them, because it is “dead meat” (meat 
    that was not slaughtered properly), even if they mentioned the name of Allah 
    over it. End quote. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah 
    ad-Daa’imah (2/264) 
They were also 
    asked: 
I am from a tribe 
    that lives near the northern border and we mix with tribes from Iraq whose 
    madhhab is idolatrous Shi‘ah; they worship domes (shrines) and call them 
    al-Hasan, al-Husayn and ‘Ali, and when one of them gets up, he says “O ‘Ali, 
    O Husayn.” Nevertheless, some people from our tribe have intermarried with 
    them. I tried to admonish them but they did not listen. I have heard that 
    meat slaughtered by them is not to be eaten, but these people eat meat 
    slaughtered by them and they do not care. We ask you to please explain what 
    we should do with regard to what we have mentioned. 
They replied: 
If the matter is as 
    you have mentioned, that they call upon ‘Ali, al-Husayn, al-Hasan and 
    others, then they are mushrikeen in the sense of major shirk that puts them 
    beyond the pale of Islam. Hence it is not permissible to give Muslim women 
    to them in marriage, and it is not permissible for us [Muslim men] to marry 
    their women. It is not permissible for us to eat meat slaughtered by them. 
    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
    do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship 
    Allah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free)

    (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon till they believe (in Allah 
    Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik 
    (idolater, etc.), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite 
    you to the Fire, but Allah invites (you) to Paradise and Forgiveness by His 
    Leave, and makes His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”

Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn 
    Jibreen (may Allah preserve him) was asked about eating meat slaughtered by 
    the Raafidis. 
He replied: 
Meat slaughtered by a 
    Raafidi is not halaal and may not be eaten. That is because the Raafidah are 
    usually mushrikeen who always call upon ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib at times of 
    hardship and of ease, even in ‘Arafaat and during tawaaf and sa‘i. And they 
    call upon (‘Ali’s) sons and their Imams as we have heard many times. This is 
    major shirk and apostasy from Islam, for which they deserve to be executed. 
    They also go to extremes in describing ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) 
    and ascribing to him attributes which are befitting only for Allah, as we 
    have heard them say in ‘Arafaat. Because of that they are apostates, because 
    they regard him as a lord and creator who controls the universe, has 
    knowledge of the unseen, has the power to bring benefit and cause harm, and 
    so on. They also cast aspersions upon the Holy Qur’an and claim that the 
    Sahaabah distorted it and erased many things from it having to do with Ahl 
    al-bayt (the Prophet’s family) and their enemies. Hence they do not follow 
    the Qur’an and they do not regard it as proof. They also impugn the senior 
    Sahaabah, such as the first three caliphs and the rest of the ten (who were 
    promised Paradise), and the Mothers of the Believers, and the well-known 
    Sahaabah such as Anas, Jaabir, Abu Hurayrah and others. They do not accept 
    their hadeeths because they are disbelievers, or so they claim, and they do 
    not accept the hadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim, except those 
    hadeeths that were narrated from Ahl al-Bayt. They hold fast to hadeeths 
    that have been fabricated or in which there is no evidence for what they 
    say. Yet despite that they act in a hypocritical manner, saying verbally 
    that which is not in their hearts, and they conceal in their hearts that 
    which they will not express to you. They say “The one who has no taqiyyah 
    (dissimulation) has no religion.” So do not accept their claim to be 
    brothers and to love sharee‘ah, etc. Hypocrisy is a major tenet of faith for 
    them, may Allah protect the Muslims from their evil. End quote.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/44/invalid-marriages,Ruling on interacting with a Muslim family whose daughter is married to a disbeliever,"Praise
      be to Allah.

    Firstly:
    The Ahmadiyyah – or Qadianiyyah – are a sect that is beyond 
    the pale of Islam.
    In a fatwa of the Standing Committee for Academic Research 
    and Issuing Fatwas (2/220) it says:
    Question: what is the ruling on this new religion and its 
    followers, i.e., a religion that is called Ahmadiyyah, whose missionaries 
    warn people against some verses of the Qur’an or names of Allah, and they 
    forbid sending blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
    upon him)? Where and when did this religion originate? What is the ruling on 
    those who turn away from it?
    Praise be to Allah alone, and blessings and peace be upon His 
    Messenger and his family and companions… To proceed:
    Answer: The Pakistani government has issued a ruling that 
    this sect is outside of Islam. The Muslim World League in Makkah has also 
    issued a ruling to that effect. The Conference of Islamic Organizations that 
    was held by the League in 1394 AH has published an essay which outlines the 
    principles of this sect, and how and when it originated, and other facts 
    about it.
    To sum up: it is a sect which claims that the Indian Mirza 
    Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet who received revelation, and that no person’s 
    Islam is valid unless he believes in him. He was born in the thirteenth 
    century AH, but Allah, may He be glorified, stated in His holy Book that our 
    Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the seal of 
    the Prophets (i.e., the last Prophet), and the Muslim scholars are 
    unanimously agreed on that. Hence anyone who claims that there is any 
    prophet after him who receives revelation from Allah, may He be glorified 
    and exalted, is a kaafir (disbeliever) because he has disbelieved in the 
    Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and he has disbelieved in 
    the saheeh hadeeths from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him) which indicate that he is the Seal of the Prophets, and 
    he has gone against the consensus of the ummah.
    And Allah is the source of strength; may Allah sent blessings 
    and peace upon Allah Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

    Based on that, it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to 
    marry a man from this sect, because it is not permissible for a Muslim woman 
    to marry a disbeliever.
    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    “And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon 
    till they believe (in Allah Alone)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221].
    At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    What Allah, may He be exalted, means in this verse is that He 
    has forbidden believing women to marry a mushrik (polytheist) of any 
    type. So do not, O Muslim men, give them (Muslim women) in marriage to them 
    (mushrikeen), for that is forbidden to you.

    End quote from Tafseer at-Tabari, 4/370
    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    “O you who believe! When believing women come to you as 
    emigrants, examine them, Allah knows best as to their Faith, then if you 
    ascertain that they are true believers, send them not back to the 
    disbelievers, they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the 
    disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them. But give the disbelievers that 
    (amount of money) which they have spent (as their Mahr) to them”

    [al-Mumtahinah 60:10].
    Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    Allah says: “they are not lawful (wives) for the 
    disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them”. This 
    verse is the one which prohibited Muslim women to mushrik men. 
    

    End quote. Tafseer al-Qur’an al-‘Azeem, 13/521
    This family whose daughter is married to an Ahmadi man has 
    gone against the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted, and has given their 
    daughter in a marriage that is invalid according to scholarly consensus, and 
    this has made her vulnerable to joining the kaafir sect of her husband, as 
    usually happens.
    For more information, please see fatwa no.
    144765
    Secondly:
    What is your duty with regard to this family?
    If this family is unaware of the Islamic ruling on the 
    Ahmadiyyah or is unaware of the prohibition on marriage of a Muslim woman to 
    a kaafir, then what you must do in this case is teach them and alert them to 
    this fact.
    That is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil 
    action, then let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he 
    cannot, then with his tongue [by 
    speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart – and that is the 
    weakest of faith.”

    Narrated by Muslim, 78.
    You will attain a great reward for teaching them about the 
    Islamic rulings of which they are unaware.
    The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) said: “Verily Allah and His angels, and the inhabitants of the heavens 
    and the earth, even the ant in its hole and the fish, invoke blessings upon 
    the one who teaches the people good things.”

    Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 2685; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh Sunan at-Tirmidhi, no. 2685
    But if this family is aware of the ruling on the Ahmadiyyah 
    sect, and knows that it is a kaafir sect that is beyond the pale of Islam, 
    and they know that a marriage between a kaafir man and a Muslim women is 
    haraam, but they did not pay attention to that, then in that case there is 
    nothing wrong with shunning them for the sake of Allah, so as to be harsh 
    with them, denounce the evil deeds, express disavowal of their action and 
    deter them from this way.
    Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    Chapter on what is permissible of shunning one who has 
    committed sin.
    Ka‘b said, when he lagged behind and did not join the Prophet 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – i.e., he failed to join the 
    campaign to Tabook: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    forbade the Muslims to speak to us… And he mentioned fifty days.

    End quote from Fath al-Baari (10/497).
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    What is meant by this report is to highlight the kind of 
    shunning that is permissible, because the general meaning of the prohibition 
    on shunning a Muslim applies only in the case of one who is not being 
    shunned for a legitimate shar‘i reason. But here the reason for shunning is 
    explained, which is that it is directed at a person who committed a sin, so 
    it is justified for the one who sees him doing that to shun him for that 
    reason, so that he will stop doing it.

    End quote from Fath al-Baari, 10/497
    Moreover  there is a greater reason to shun people in such 
    cases, those who commit crimes and sins, if a Muslim fears that if he mixes 
    with them he may be influenced by their sins, or he may join them in that, 
    or that he may be spoken ill of, or that it may be detrimental to his 
    religious commitment or his worldly interests
    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    My view is that if a person fears that sitting with him or 
    talking to him may be detrimental to his religious commitment or worldly 
    interests, and may increase enmity and resentment, then shunning him and 
    keeping away from him is better than staying close to him, because that will 
    protect you from slipping and from his specious arguments against what you 
    believe is correct, and you will not be safe from the bad consequences of 
    mixing with them. Shunning (in a peaceful manner) may be better than mixing 
    which may lead to trouble.

    End quote from al-Istidhkaar, 26/149-150
    In fact whether you should continue your ties with this 
    family, or denounce them, or shun them, depends on the nature of the 
    relationship between you and them, and what shunning is likely to lead to of 
    serving a legitimate shar‘i interest or may lead to negative consequences 
    that outweigh any shar‘i interest. Moreover we think that what is usual in 
    such cases is that your relationship with them is not strong, and there is 
    no direct connection between you and a family such as this; rather the 
    matter has to do with your sister who is married to one of them, and does 
    not have anything to do with you.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    said:
    Shunning varies according to how strong or weak, and how few 
    or how numerous the people who are doing the shunning are. The purpose is to 
    rebuke and discipline the person being shunned and to deter the masses from 
    doing likewise.  

    If the purpose is more likely be to achieved by shunning, and 
    it will weaken and reduce the evil, then it is prescribed, but if the person 
    being shunned and others will not be deterred by that, rather the evil will 
    increase, and the person doing the shunning is weak and the bad consequences 
    will outweigh the good, then shunning is not prescribed, rather softening 
    the hearts of some people is more effective than shunning.

    The one who is faced with that and cannot find a school or

    away from women and talking to them, let alone making friends with them, 
    except for when there is a real need to talk to them, in which case he 
    should talk with them only as much as is necessary.
    What appears to be the case from your question is that you 
    are not compelled to do these things, in addition to the doubt that it 
    causes in this sister’s mind. Hence what you have to do is give it up and 
    avoid this girl and others, and remember that if it were not for the need 
    for education, it would not be permissible to you to remain in this mixed 
    environment.
    If you can change to a study group other than the one in 
    which this sister is, then do that. If not, then refrain from these

My question is: is it permissible for the Muslims not to celebrate Eid because of what is happening of tragedies in Palestine, especially if the Muslim feels grief and sorrow because of that?","Praise
      be to Allah

	The Eids of the Muslims have not been prescribed only for the 
	purpose of joy, fun and visiting one another; rather they are among the 
	symbols and acts of worship of the religion, so the Sunnah on these 
	occasions is for the Muslims to celebrate them openly and proclaim them.
	Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) 
	said:

	The Eids are among the most specific distinguishing features 
	of different religions, and among the most obvious of their rituals.

	End quote from Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem (1/528)

	Hence you will find that every religion has its own festivals 
	that its followers care about and celebrate openly, because they are an 
	important part of their religion.

	Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

	Expressing joy on the occasion of the Eids is one of the 
	symbols of the religion.

	End quote from Fath al-Baari (2/443)

	So expressing joy on Eid is one of the acts of worship by 
	which the Muslim draws closer to Allah.

	Ahmad (24334) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased 
	with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) said on that day – i.e., the day on which the Ethiopians played in the 
	mosque: “Let the Jews know that in our religion there is lenience. Verily I 
	have been sent with an easygoing religion.”

	Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ 
	(3219).

	Moreover, there is no contradiction between expressing joy on 
	Eid and feeling sorrow for what has befallen the Muslims and grieving for 
	their situation. The Muslim expresses his joy on Eid in order to show his 
	religious commitment openly and to show his support for his religion and at 
	the same time he shares the sorrows of the Muslims.

	So the Muslim should combine both matters: he should practice 
	the rituals and acts of worship of Islam openly, such as the Eid prayer, and 
	he should express some measure of joy and happiness. And at the same time he 
	should feel sorrow for what has befallen his brethren, and he should feel 
	their pain.
	Undoubtedly the more the Muslim feels the pain and anguish of 
	his Muslim brothers, the less he will indulge in permissible kinds of 
	entertainment and play, even if he allows himself expressions of joy on Eid 
	and gratitude for the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon him.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/189/images-and-image-making,I am a woman who would like to work in the field of children’s stories and children’s magazines. Illustrations for children usually include pictures of animate beings. Is it permissible for me to draw the faces but omit some features so that they will not be imitating the creation of Allaah?.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    told us that the one who makes images – by drawing or engraving –will be 
    punished on the Day of Resurrection, and these images whose makers are given 
    this warning are images of animate beings, based on what its says in the 
    hadeeth, that Allaah will say: “Give life to that which you have crated.”
    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Those who make images will be punished on the Day 
    of Resurrection, and it will be said to them: ‘Bring to life that which you 
    have created.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5607) and Muslim (2108).
    It seems that images with incomplete features and those which 
    do not have a nose or eyes are not included in the images that are haraam, 
    and their makers are not included in the warning, because they cannot really 
    be called images and these pictures are not competing with the creation of 
    Allaah.
    It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    her) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Among the people who will be most severely punished on the 
    Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of Allaah.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5610) and Muslim (2107).
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said:
    With regard to stuffed toys in which the image is not clear, 
    even though there are limbs, heads and shoulders, but they have no eyes or 
    noses, there is nothing wrong with them because this is not competing with 
    the creation of Allaah.
    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (2/ question no. 330).
    The Shaykh also said:
    Every one who does something that is competing with the 
    creation of Allaah, is included in the hadeeth which is: The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the image-makers… and he 
    said: “The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of 
    Resurrection will be the image-makers.” But as I said, if the image is not 
    clear, i.e., it does not have eyes or a nose or a mouth or fingers, then 
    this is not a complete image, and is not competing with the creation of 
    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.

Sometimes thoughts come to me nowadays which say: When I was in the second year of secondary school I deliberately broke the fast and I am deliberately breaking the fast now as well.
However, I do not remember breaking the fast. Because of this sickness I have begun to forget many things and I cannot remember them. Is it true that I might have broken the fast?","Praise be to Allah
So long as you do not remember breaking the fast in Ramadan, this doubt that has occurred to you is waswasah (whispers) from the Shaytan, and you do not have to do anything. The scholars have mentioned a principle which states that if the Muslim does an act of worship, then after he finishes it, he is uncertain as to whether he did it correctly or not, then he should not pay any attention to this doubt, and his act of worship is valid. 
Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This principle is very important. Uncertainty after completing an act of worship does not affect the act of worship. For some people, when they have finished praying and said the salam (salutation for ending prayer), the Shaytan comes to them and says: You did not recite al-Fatihah, you only prostrated once. Uncertainty in this case should be ignored, because uncertainty after completing an act of worship does not affect it. 
Many people face a great deal of uncertainty and can hardly do any act of worship without feeling uncertain. This uncertainty should also be ignored and no attention should be paid to it, because it is a kind of waswas. End quote. 
Duroos wa Fatawa al-Haram al-Madani, p. 153 
Based on that, if the Shaytan comes and whispers to you that you broke the fast, do not pay any attention to this uncertainty and do not focus on thinking about it. 
One of the anecdotes that was mentioned concerning that is what was said by Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him): 
We have heard that a man came to Abu Hazim and said to him: The Shaytan comes to me and says: You have divorced your wife, and he makes me uncertain. He said to him: Did you not divorce her? He said: No. He said: Did you not come to me yesterday and divorce her in my presence? He said: By Allah, I only came to you today and I did not divorce her in any way whatsoever. He said: Swear to the Shaytan that if he comes to you as you have sworn to me, you will be fine. End quote. 
Al-Adhkiya, p. 31 
The best remedy for this waswas is to remember Allah a great deal, call upon Him in du‘a (supplication) and seek refuge with Him from the Shaytan. Then after that, ignore this waswas and do not pay any attention to it. It is essential to put a stop to these thoughts and not get carried away with them. Even though this is difficult to do, it is the remedy.

It is not permissible to swear by prayer, honesty, critical

          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears, let 
          him swear by Allaah or keep silent.” (Saheeh, 
          agreed upon). And he  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by anything other 
          than Allaah has committed shirk.” 
          (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Umar (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him)). It was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawood 
          with a saheeh isnaad from 
          Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), with the wording, “Whoever 
          swears by anything other than Allaah has committed kufr 
          or shirk.” And the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by honesty is not one of us.” So 
          every believing man and woman has to beware of that and not swear by 
          anything except Allaah alone, so he should say “Wallaahi (by Allaah) I did not do such and such”, etc., if 
          that is necessary. What is recommended in sharee’ah is to be cautious 
          about swearing oaths, and not to swear except when essential. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And protect your oaths (i.e. 
          do not swear much)”[al-Maa’idah 5:89] 
 But if it is necessary, then one may swear by saying, 
          “By Allaah, I did not do such and such”, provided that he is telling 
          the truth, or, “By Allaah, I did not go to So and so” etc. If he is 
          telling the truth, then there is nothing wrong with that, because this 
          is swearing by Allaah when there is a need to do so. But swearing by 
          honesty or by the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by the Ka’bah, or by the life 
          of So and so, or by the honour of So and so, or by my prayer, or by 
          my honesty – this is not permissible, as stated above, because of the 
          ahaadeeth quoted. 
 But if a person says “Trust me (lit. in my trust)”, 
          this is not an oath; this means that this is something which has been 
          entrusted to me and for which I am responsible. But if a person says 
          “by my trust/ by my prayer/ by my father’s life”, this is not permissible, 
          because he is swearing by something other than Allaah. We ask Allaah 
          to guide us all."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/250/calling-non-muslims-to-islam,"For up to many times should we conduct Islamic lectures to a group of non-muslims who seems not interested to what we are conveying.  We are a volunteer dawah brothers and we use to visit workshops, factories, hospitals to make dawah. Oftentimes we make a visit which last 4 to 5 times in one place. But we noticed nobody is listening. Some only stayed just because the owner of the establishment ordered (obliges) them to attend.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    We ask Allaah to reward you with good, and to bless your work and your efforts. 
There is no specific number of times that you should give lectures to those whom 
    you mention. That depends on the number of places you visit and the time that is given to you, and the extent to which the people are responsive. 
    The daa’iyah is required to be wise in giving da’wah. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would try to choose the right 
    time for preaching to his companions so that they would not get bored, and this is how you should be. Strive to call people to Islam in a way that 
    is better, and choose suitable times and places for da’wah. 
The daa’iyah should not despair if he makes da’wah time after time and sees little 
    response. Hearts are in the hand of Allaah, and all the daa’iyah has to do is to convey the message. A word that the daa’iyah thinks little of may 
    have an effect on a person’s heart years later, and may be the cause of his being guided. 
In order for this word to bear fruit, it should be accompanied with a smile, 
    compassion and a sincere desire to save these poor people and bring them forth from the darkness of kufr and atheism.  If the daa’iyah can add 
    some money or help to his words, let him do so, for that give credibility to the values and principles to which he is calling people, and may 
    prepare people’s hearts to accept the goodness that comes to them and remove any hatred, resistance and objections. 
Also strive to solve any problems that these people may have with their bosses at 
    work. This will have a great effect in softening their hearts towards the daa’iyah. Long ago the poet said: 
Be kind to people, you will win their hearts… 
Even better than that is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one 
    which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then 
    verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend”
[Fussilat 41:34]
You should leave with these people something that they can look at in their spare 
    time, when you are not there, such as pamphlets and booklets. If a person thinks about the truth when he is on his own, he is more likely to 
    accept it and submit to it. 
Part of your da’wah should be addressed to the bosses themselves, advising them to 
    treat these workers well and to show them the good morals and attitudes of Islam. Often that is a cause of the workers embracing Islam, just as 
    the bad attitude of a boss and his mistreatment of his workers may be a cause of their resisting Islam. 
May Allaah help you to guide others and make you truly guided. 
And Allaah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/27/daeef-weak-hadeeths,"I heard that the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “Verily, your Walee (Protector or Helper) is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, - those who perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, and they bow down (submit themselves with obedience to Allah in prayer)” [al-Maa’idah 5:55] was revealed concerning ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him), who gave his ring in charity when he was bowing [in prayer]. Is this hadith saheeh?","Praise
      be to Allah

	This hadith is fabricated; it was fabricated and propagated 
	by some of the liars in order to prove thereby the virtue of ‘Ali (may Allah 
	be pleased with him). But the virtues of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with 
	him) are many and well known, and there is no need for lies such as this.
	When reflecting upon this hadith, it becomes clear that it 
	does not offer proof of the virtue of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).
	This was explained by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah 
	have mercy on him) who said:
	Some of the liars fabricated a false hadith which says that 
	this verse was revealed concerning ‘Ali when he gave his ring in charity 
	whilst praying. This is false according to the consensus of the scholars of 
	hadith, and its falseness is apparent from many angles:
	·
	The verse says “those 
	who”, which is plural, 
	and ‘Ali was one person.
	·
	The waw [translated as “and” in the phrase “, 
	and they bow down (submit themselves with obedience to Allah in prayer)”] 
	is not describing the state or situation of the people in question [so it 
	does not mean “whilst”]. If that were the case, it would not be appropriate 
	for any Muslim to take as a protector or helper anyone except one who gives 
	zakaah whilst bowing, and therefore he should not take as a protector or 
	helper anyone else among the Sahaabah or relatives of the Prophet (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him).
	·
	Words of praise usually only apply to obligatory or 
	mustahabb actions. Giving zakaah whilst praying is neither obligatory nor 
	mustahabb, according to the consensus of Muslim scholars, because the person 
	who is praying is already preoccupied.

	·
	If giving charity whilst praying were something good, 
	there would be no difference between doing that whilst bowing and otherwise; 
	rather it would be more convenient to give it whilst standing and sitting.

	·
	‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was not obligated to 
	give zakaah at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) [because he did not enough wealth of his own to be obliged to pay 
	zakaah].

	·
	He did not have a ring either, because they did not wear 
	rings, until the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wrote a 
	letter to Chosroes, and was told that they would not accept any letter 
	unless it had a seal, so he acquired a ring of silver and had engraved on it 
	the words “Muhammad the Messenger of Allah”.

	·
	Giving something other than a ring in zakaah is better 
	than giving a ring, because most of the fuqaha’ say: Giving a ring is not 
	acceptable as zakaah.

	·
	This hadith says that he gave it to someone who asked for 
	charity. What is praiseworthy with regard to zakaah is to take the 
	initiative in giving it and to give it as soon as it becomes due, not to 
	wait for someone to ask for it.

	·
	The words come in the context of forbidding taking 
	disbelievers as protectors and helpers, and enjoining taking believers as 
	protectors and helpers, as is indicated by the context.

	this hadith and he said:
	This hadith is not saheeh. It was mentioned by al-Haafiz Ibn 
	Katheer in his Tafseer, where he deemed it to be da‘eef (weak), 
	because the men of its isnaad are da‘eef, and some of them are unknown. He 
	stated that as far as he knew, not one of the scholars spoke of the virtue 
	of giving charity whilst bowing. End quote.
	Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) 
	said in Minhaaj as-Sunnah that this hadith is fabricated.
	Thus it is known that what is meant by the words of Allah, 
	may He be exalted, “and 
	they bow down” is that 
	they humble themselves before Allah, may He be exalted, because bowing and 
	prostration represent the utmost humility before Allah. So the believer 
	gives charity in a state of humility before Allah, not in a state of 
	arrogance or showing pride in one’s actions, and not showing off or seeking 
	to enhance one’s reputation. And Allah is the source of strength. End

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/156/inheritance-and-distribution-of-the-estate,"We are three sons, three daughters and a mother. We inherited 14,500 Jordanian dinars from our father and we invested this money in some business; every month we get 215 Jordanian dinars. Is any zakaah due on this amount, because this money belongs to everyone?.","Praise be to Allaah.
    
    Firstly:
    The mother’s share of the estate is 
    one-eighth. The rest is to be divided among the sons and daughters, with 
    each male getting the share of two females. If we realise that the nisaab 
    (minimum threshold) for zakaah is the value of 595 grams of silver, then the 
    share of each member of the family reaches the nisaab by itself, so each one 
    should pay zakaah – one quarter of one tenth – himself, after one full 
    (hijri) year has passed; he should pay it himself if he does not have any 
    other wealth or he should add it to whatever of that wealth he owns.
    The same should be done every year; the 
    share of each individual should be examined. Any individual whose share 
    reaches the nisaab, of gold or silver, must pay zakaah on it. Anyone whose 
    wealth falls short of the nisaab is not obliged to pay zakaah on it.
    Secondly:
    Each individual may pay zakaah on his share, 
    but if you have made the wealth as if it is the wealth of one individual, 
    then zakaah should be paid on the entire amount.
    See the answer to question no. 
    156008
    Thirdly:
    Wealth that results from the capital is 
    profits that should be divided among you according to the share of 
    inheritance that each person had; whatever has been spent is not subject to 
    any (zakaah); whatever has been saved should be added to one’s wealth and 
    zakaah paid on it when one full (hijri) year has passed.
    The obligation to give zakaah, and the rate, 
    vary according to the nature of the business in which the money has been 
    invested. If the business has to do with trade goods and dealing in 
    electrical or electronic goods and equipment that are sold to people, zakaah 
    must be paid on the business at a rate of one quarter of one tenth. That 
    should be based on the market value at the end of the year; zakaah must be 
    paid based on that value. If the business is a commercial venture in which 
    no goods are sold, such as if it involves vehicles for hire, apartments or 
    other real estate for rent, or production tools, then no zakaah is due on it 
    in the first place; rather zakaah must be paid on income generated, if it 
    reaches the zakaah, when one full (hijri) year has passed.

    69912
    Fifthly:
    We would like to draw your attention to 
    something that may have been a mistake in your getting involved in this 
    business, because you said in your question that the income is fixed – 215 
    dinars. This may mean one of two things:
    (i)
    It is halaal, which 
    is if the business is an apartment that is rented out, for example, and has 
    a rent that is fixed at this amount. The same applies if the business is a 
    car that is hired out to someone for this amount.

    (ii)
    It is haraam, which 
    is if there is a mudaarabah transaction with someone who does business with 
    the money and gives you a fixed amount that is not a ratio of the profits. 
    The reason why this is prohibited is that a transaction of this nature is a 
    “loan that brings benefits.” Any mudaarabah transaction in which the capital 
    is preserved or brings an income of fixed value is a prohibited transaction.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/208/innovations-in-religion-and-worship,"‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) united the people in praying Tarweeh, and said: That is a good innovation (bid‘ah hasanah). Why did he describe it as an innovation, even though he was one of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs whose words and deeds we are instructed to follow, as they are part of the Sunnah?","Praise
      be to Allah
      
		Firstly:
	Al-Bukhaari (2010) narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari’ 
	that he said: I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased 
	with him) one night in Ramadan to the mosque, where we saw the people in 
	scattered groups, one man praying by himself, and another man praying with a 
	group of people following his prayer. ‘Umar said: I think that if I unite 
	these people behind one reciter, it will be better. Then he decided to do 
	that, so he united them behind Ubayy ibn Ka‘b. Then I went out with him on 
	another night, and the people were all praying behind their reciter. ‘Umar 
	said: What a good innovation this is, but what they sleep and miss is better 
	than what they are doing – referring to prayer at the end of the night, 
	whereas the people were praying qiyaam at the beginning of the night.
	With regard to ‘Umar’s words “what a good innovation (bid‘ah) 
	this is”, what he meant by calling it an innovation was in the linguistic 
	sense, i.e., it was something new that the people had never done before.
	That was because gathering the people in Ramadan every night 
	behind one imam on a continual and organised basis had not been done before. 
	Therefore the context indicates that what was meant was the linguistic 
	meaning, and he did not mean it in the technical shar‘i sense, which means 
	introducing something into the religion that is not part of it, whilst 
	attributing it to the religion. Taraweeh prayer is part of the religion and 
	is something that is prescribed and encouraged; similarly, offering this 
	prayer in congregation is also encouraged and recommended, and the basis for 
	that is proven in the actions and words of the Prophet (blessings and peace 
	of Allah be upon him).
	The scholars have stated that:
	Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) 
	said:
	This is a description in linguistic terms, not in a technical 
	shar‘i sense. That is because the word innovation (bid‘ah), in linguistic 
	terms, includes everything that is introduced without precedent.

	With regard to innovation (bid‘ah) in the technical, shar‘i 
	sense, this refers to something for which there is no shar‘i evidence.
	If the words of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace 
	of Allah be upon him) indicate that something is recommended or obligatory 
	after his death, or is indicated in general terms, even though it was not 
	done until after his death – such as the book of charity [a document 
	that listed the rates of zakaah on livestock] that Abu Bakr (may Allah be 
	pleased with him) issued – then doing that action after his death may 
	correctly be called an innovation in linguistic terms, because it was 
	something new.
	In fact the very religion that the Prophet (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him) brought may be called an innovation and may be 
	called something new in linguistic terms, as the envoys of Quraysh said to 
	the Negus (ruler of Abyssinia) concerning the companions of the Prophet 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) who migrated to Abyssinia: These 
	people left the religion of their forefathers and did not enter the religion 
	of the King [i.e., Christianity]; rather they brought an innovated religion 
	that is not known.
	Moreover, a deed which is supported by the Qur’an and Sunnah 
	is not an innovation in shar‘i terms, even if it may be described as an 
	innovation in linguistic terms. The word innovation is more general in 
	meaning in the linguistic sense than in the technical shar‘i sense.
	It is known that the words of the Prophet (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him), “Every innovation is a going astray,” do not 
	refer to every new thing that is done. In fact the religion of Islam – and 
	indeed every religion brought by the Messengers – was a new thing. Rather 
	what he meant is what is newly introduced of deeds (in the religion) that 
	were not prescribed by him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).
	As that is the case, they used to pray the qiyaam of Ramadan 
	(i.e., Taraweeh) at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
	upon him) both in congregation and individually. He said to them on the 
	third or fourth night, when they gathered: “Nothing prevented me from coming 
	out to join you except the fact that I would not like it to be made 
	obligatory for you. So pray in your houses, for the best prayer a man can 
	offer is in his house, except the prescribed obligatory prayers.”
	So he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained 
	the reason why he did not come out (to lead them in Taraweeh prayers), which 
	was the fear that it might be made obligatory. Thus it is known that the 
	reason for his coming out to join them was still valid, and that were it not 
	for the fear of it being made obligatory, he would have come out to join 
	them.
	But at the time of ‘Umar’s caliphate, he (may Allah be 
	pleased with him) united them behind a single reciter and put lamps in the 
	mosque. This way of doing it – which was to gather in the mosque behind a 
	single imam, with lamps in the mosque – was something that they had not done 
	before, hence it was called an innovation, because it may be described as 
	such in linguistic terms, but it was not an innovation in shar‘i terms, 
	because the Sunnah indicates that it was a righteous deed, were it not for 
	the fear that it might be made obligatory. Fear that it might be made 
	obligatory ceased with the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
	Allah be upon him), so there was no longer any reason not to do it.
	End quote from Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem 
	(2/95-97)
	Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	With regard to what was said by some of the earlier 
	generations about regarding some innovations as good, that refers to 
	innovation in the linguistic sense, not in the technical shar‘i sense. An 
	example of that is what ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, when he 
	united the people in praying qiyaam in Ramadan behind a single imam in the 
	mosque; when he came out and saw the people praying in that manner, he said: 
	What a good innovation this is. And it was narrated from him that he said: 
	If this is an innovation, then what a good innovation. What he meant was 
	that this deed had not been done in this manner before this time, but it had 
	a basis in Islamic teaching that may be referred to, such as the fact that 
	the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to encourage and 
	urge people to pray qiyaam in Ramadan. At his time, the people used to pray 
	qiyaam in the mosque, in scattered groups and individually, and he 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led his companions in praying 
	qiyaam in Ramadan for several nights. Then he stopped doing that, on the 
	basis that he feared that it might be made obligatory for them, then they 
	would be unable to do it, but there was no fear of that after he (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him) died.
	End quote from Jaami‘ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (2/783)
	Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	The scholars have explained that what ‘Umar meant by that was 
	the linguistic sense, according to Arabic usage, because he (may Allah be 
	pleased with him) united the people behind a single imam, whereas at the 
	time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr 
	as-Siddeeq they used to pray in scattered groups. During his time (may Allah 
	be pleased with him), he united them behind a single imam; he passed by them 
	one night as they were praying and said: What a good innovation this is, 
	i.e., uniting them behind a single imam in an ongoing and organised 
	fashion.
	This has to do with the linguistic meaning according to 
	Arabic usage; he did not mean that it was an innovations in the technical, 
	shar‘i sense. It is not possible that he (may Allah be pleased with him) 
	could have introduced or approved of (reprehensible) innovations.
	End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (3/33)
	Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	The words of ‘Umar, “What a good innovation this is”, do not 
	refer to innovation in the technical shar‘i sense, which means introducing 
	something into the religion with no precedent. Rather he was referring to 
	innovation in a linguistic sense, which is something new that was not known 
	before he introduced it. There can be no doubt that offering Taraweeh prayer 
	in congregation behind a single imam was not known or practised during the 
	caliphate of Abu Bakr and the first half of ‘Umar’s caliphate, so in that 
	sense it was something new. But because it was in accordance with what the 
	Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, it is Sunnah and is 
	not an innovation, and he only described it is good because of that.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/86/leading-prayer,"Is it possible for someone to invalidate the salat of another person? For example, can the imam invalidate the prayers of everyone else without them knowing?.","Praise be to Allaah.
    
    The scholars differed concerning the relationship between a 
    person’s prayer and the prayer of the imam. There are three opinions:

    (i)That there is no connection 
    between them and each person is praying on his own account. This is the 
    prevailing view among the Shafaa‘is.

    (ii)That it is connected to the 
    imam’s prayer and stems from it, so any fault that affects the imam’s prayer 
    will affect the prayer of the one who is praying behind him. This is the 
    view of Abu Haneefah and is narrated in one report from Ahmad.

    (iii)That it is connected to the 
    imam’s prayer, but it only affects the prayer of the one who is praying 
    behind him when there is no excuse on the part of either of them. But if 
    there is an excuse, a defect in the imam’s prayer does not affect the prayer 
    of the one who is praying behind him. If the imam believes that he has 
    wudoo’, then he is excused for leading the people in prayer and the one who 
    is praying behind him is excused for following him in prayer. This is the 
    view of Maalik, Ahmad and others and this is what could be understood from 
    the report narrated from the Sahaabah concerning this issue. And this is the 
    soundest approach.

    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa by Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), 23/370-371
    Thus the prayer of one who is praying behind an imam is not 
    necessarily invalidated as soon as the imam’s prayer becomes invalidated, 
    because if the one who is praying behind him does his prayer properly, 
    fulfilling all its conditions and doing all of its essential and obligatory 
    parts, it is not permissible to regard it as invalid except with sound 
    evidence. This is indicated by the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (694) and 
    Ahmad (8449) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to 
    which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    said: “They lead you in prayer; if they do it properly then it is for you 
    and for them, but if they make a mistake then it is for you and against 
    them.”
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    Ibn al-Mundhir said: This hadeeth refutes those who say that

    behind him is also rendered invalid. End quote.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    said:
    This is a text which shows that if the imam makes a mistake 
    it is his responsibility and not that of those who are praying behind him.

    Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 23/372
    Al-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    The correct view is that the prayer of the one who is praying 
    behind an imam is not rendered invalid in all cases if the prayer of his 
    imam becomes invalid, even if the imam’s prayer became invalid during the 
    prayer and he exited it. The one who is praying behind the imam may carry on 
    with his prayer, either on his own, or one of them may lead them in the rest 
    of the prayer. This is a strong report from Imam Ahmad. End quote.
    al-Fataawa al-Sa‘diyyah, 7/120

    Based on that, if the prayer of the imam became invalid for 
    some reason which has nothing to do with the prayer of the one who is 
    praying behind him, then the prayer of the latter is not rendered invalid, 
    such as if the imam prayed without wudoo’ by mistake, or he lost his wudoo’ 
    during the prayer.
    There are some cases in which the prayer of the one who is 
    praying behind the imam does become invalid if the prayer of the imam is 
    rendered invalid. For example:
    -If the imam’s prayer becomes 
    invalid for an obvious reason that could not be hidden from those who are 
    praying behind him, and they continue following him in prayer, such as if he 
    did not face the qiblah or cover his ‘awrah, or he failed to say takbeerat 
    al-ihram (the opening takbeer) or to recite al-Faatihah in a prayer in which 
    Qur’aan is to be recited out loud.

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If other 
    conditions are not met by the imam, such as covering (his ‘awrah) and facing 
    the qiblah, the one who is praying behind him cannot be excused, because 
    such things usually cannot be hidden, unlike minor impurity (losing one’s 
    wudoo’) and najaasah (impurity, i.e., on his clothes). End quote.
    Al-Mughni, 1/420
    The prayer of the imam and the one who is following him is 
    rendered invalid if there passes between the imam and his sutrah anything 
    that interrupts the prayer, such as a woman, a donkey or a black dog. If a 
    woman walks in between the imam and his sutrah, his prayer is rendered 
    invalid, as is the prayer of those who are praying behind him, because the 
    sutrah of the imam is the sutrah of those who are praying behind him, as the 
    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you 
    stands to pray, he will be screened if he has something in front of him that 
    is like the back of a saddle. If he does not have something in front of him 
    that is like the back of a saddle, then his prayer will be interrupted if a 
    donkey, a woman or a black dog passes in front of him.” Narrated by Muslim, 
    510.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/85/prayer-of-the-traveler,"If I want to travel by plane and the time of take-off is before ‘Asr begins, and the take-off of the second flight is immediately after the first plane lands, is it permissible to combine ‘Asr with Zuhr and shorten them in my home city? What is the ruling if I do that? What is the correct thing to do?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    It is permissible for the person who is not travelling to 
    combine two prayers if it will be too difficult for him to perform the 
    second prayer on time. Permission to join prayers is broader than permission 
    to shorten them, because shortening them is allowed only to travelers, but 
    both travelers and non-travellers are permitted to join prayers when it will 
    be difficult to perform the second prayer, whether on time or in 
    congregation.

    Based on this, it is permissible for you to bring ‘Asr 
    forward and pray it with Zuhr in your home city, if you think it most likely 
    that you will not be able to pray it on time because of travelling.
    If the airport is outside your city, you can pray in the 
    airport and shorten your prayers. If you live near the airport, then you can 
    join the prayers but you cannot shorten them.
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
    Question:
    If a person is in Qaseem and goes out to the airport, can he 
    shorten his prayers in the airport?
    Answer:
    Yes, he may shorten his prayers, because he has left the 
    built-up area of his town, and all the villages that are around the airport 
    are separate from the town. But if a person lives near the airport, he 
    should not shorten his prayer, because he has not yet left the built-up area 
    of his town.
    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/514 
It was narrated that Ibn 
    ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) prayed Zuhr and ‘Asr together in Madeenah, at a time when there 
    was no fear and he was not travelling. Abu’l-Zubayr said: I asked Sa’eed 
    [i.e., ibn Jubayr], Why did he do that? He said, I asked Ibn ‘Abbaas the 
    same question, and he said, He did not want anyone among his ummah to suffer 
    hardship.
    Narrated by Muslim, 705.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:
    The specific reason for shortening the prayers is travelling, 
    and it is not permissible to shorten prayers when not travelling. With 
    regard to joining prayers, the reason for it is if there is a need or an 
    excuse. So if a person needs to do so, he may join prayers whilst 
    travelling, whether he is travelling a long distance or a short one, and he 
    may join prayers because of rain etc., or because of sickness etc., or for 
    any other reason, because the point is to spare the Muslims any difficulty 
    or hardship.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/267/childrens-upbringing,"How can I reconcile between being a modern teenage girl and a girl who pleases her family and is loved by all, and how can I rid myself of a friend whom I do not like and I cannot find any way to like her?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    You should note that the stage of adolescence is the most 
    dangerous stage that a person goes through, because during this stage there 
    are many physical, mental, emotional and sexual changes, and the shaytaan is 
    keen to tempt a person during this stage by whatever means and methods he 
    can. Hence every adolescent boy and girl must be cautious. What we recommend 
    at this stage is:
    Firstly: 

    Strive to do acts of worship, both obligatory and mustahabb, 
    and strive to keep away from haram (impermissible), doubtful and makrooh (disliked) things.
    Among the means which will help you to avoid falling into the 
    trap of the shaytaan and keep away from disobedience to Allaah are:
    -Remembering that Allaah is 
    always watching and bearing in mind His greatness, especially when you are 
    alone. 

    -Not following in the footsteps 
    of the shaytaan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who 
    believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows 
    the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al‑Fahsha’ 
    [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al‑Munkar 
    [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or 
    to do what is forbidden in Islam)]” [al-Noor 24:21]. The steps of the 
    shaytaan are like a chain; the one who follows them will not stop and each 
    step is more serious than the one that came before it, unless a person 
    checks himself and gives it up and repents from every sin. 
    

    -Repenting from every sin. A 
    Muslim may fall into sin, but if that happens what he must do is give it up 
    and repent, and not continue and persist in it. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): “And those who, when they have committed Faahishah 
    (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember 
    Allaah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but 
    Allaah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know” 
    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:135]. And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who 
    commit sin are those who repent.” Narrated by Ibn Majaah (4251).  Shaykh 
    al-Albaani said: It is hasan. 

    -Thinking of death and the 
    meeting with Allaah. The one who remembers that death may come to him 
    suddenly and that he will meet Allaah, Who will ask him about his deeds, 
    will avoid sin.

    -Turning to Allaah and praying 
    that He will help you to do good deeds and give up evil deeds, for Allaah 
    will never let down the one who calls upon Him. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then 
    (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the 
    invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or 
    intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led 
    aright” [al-Baqarah 2:186]. 

    Secondly: 

    Strive to find good companions and keep away from bad 
    companions, for a friend will have an impact on his friends, as it was said:
    

    Do not ask about a man, rather ask about his friend, for 
    every friend follows the example of his friends.
    Thirdly:

    You should fill your time with beneficial and useful things, 
    both religious and worldly, and beware of free time for it is one of the 
    greatest sources of corruption at this stage.
    Fourthly: 

    If you want to win people’s hearts, then treat them kindly 
    and have a good attitude towards them, cooperate with them and meet their 
    needs, for in this way you will be able to win their hearts. 
    Among the wisdom narrated from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) are his words:
    Do favours to whoever you want and you will be like his 
    master, and be in need of whoever you want and you will be like his 
    prisoner, and be independent of whoever you want and you will be his equal. 
    
    We will say something in general terms about winning people’s 
    hearts and earning their love.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allaah and 
    in His Messenger (Muhammad )] and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious (Allaah) will bestow love 
    for them(in the hearts of the believers)”

    [Maryam 19:96]

    Qataadah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his 
    commentary on this verse: This means, by Allaah, in the hearts of the 
    believers. It was mentioned to us that Haram ibn Hayaan used to say: No 
    person turns with all his heart to Allaah but Allaah will turn the hearts of 
    the believers towards him, until He blesses him with their love and 
    compassion. Tafseer al-Tabari (18/266).
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah 
    loves a person, He calls Jibreel (A) and says: ‘I love So and so, so love 
    him.’ So Jibreel loves him, then he calls out to the people of heaven, 
    ‘Allaah loves So and so, so love him.’ So the people of heaven love him and 
    he finds acceptance on earth. If Allaah hates someone, He calls Jibreel and 
    says: ‘I hate So and so, so hate him.’ So Jibreel hates him, then he calls 
    out to the people of heaven: ‘Allaah hates So and so, so hate him.’ So they 
    hate him and he is hated on earth.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7485) and 
    Muslim (2637).
    Now you see that winning people’s hearts and earning their 
    love is not within your capacity or that of any other human being, rather it 
    is in the hand of Allaah alone, may He be glorified and exalted. He is the 
    One Who softens hearts towards one another and He is the One Who separates 
    them. He is the One Who gives and withholds, lowers and raises. All of this 
    is part and parcel of His being the Rabb (Lord or Cherisher and Sustainer) 
    of His creation, may He be glorified.
    As for how to attain the love of Allaah, this is the greatest 
    desire of the believer, and this is the great and noble purpose for which 
    there is only one way to attain it, which is by following and obeying His 
    Prophet. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me 
    (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), Allaah 
    will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most 
    Merciful”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31]

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whosoever shows enmity to someone 
    devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My slave draws not near to Me 
    with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined 
    upon him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory 
    works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which 
    he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and 
    his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would 
    surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely 
    grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about 
    [seizing] the soul of My faithful slave: he hates death and I hate hurting 
    him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6502).
    If there remain after that people 
    of evil and corruption who love to spread evil among those who believe, and 
    they want to harm you, and want you to agree with them, and are annoyed by 
    your obedience to the Most Merciful, and your keenness to worship Him and 
    attain all the branches of faith, then do not pay any attention to them, and 
    continue on your straight path, and be with His righteous slaves.
    Here we should point out the 
    importance of respecting parents and relatives, for they are the most 
    deserving of good treatment and of your efforts to win their hearts. It is 
    essential to be patient with parents when they regard you as still being 
    young, because no matter how old you get, you are still young in your 
    parents’ eyes. Moreover they have the right of being in charge of you, 
    looking after you, raising and teaching you, and disciplining you. They are 
    entrusted with your care, and are responsible for you in this world and in 
    the Hereafter. Part of their duty is that they should ensure that you follow 
    proper etiquette and pay attention to the rulings of Islam, and respect the 
    people’s customs and traditions so long as they do not go against sharee’ah. 
    All of that may conflict with the desires and inclinations of teenagers, 
    which may lead to the situation that you describe, and you feel that it is a 
    problem, i.e., reconciling between what is required of you as a teenager and 
    the whims and desires of your own nafs (desirous soul), and what the duties of etiquette 
    demand of you, and what your parents’ rights dictate, that you should 
    respect and accept the guardianship of your parents. 
    Hence you will know the answer to 
    the rest of your question. If this friend is a good person, then try to love 
    her and grow close to her, and if she is a bad and corrupt person, then keep 
    away from her and she will also keep away from you.
    “Bad 
    statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for 
    bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good 
    people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or 
    good men for good women): such (good people) are
    innocent of (every) bad statement which 
    they say; for them is forgiveness, and Rizqun Kareem (generous provision, 
    i.e. Paradise)”

But it seems to me that there is a problem here. Let us assume that I am one of the people of the lower degrees of paradise, but seeing that I will attain everything I want, I will undoubtedly ask Allah to make me among the people of the higher levels. Will my Lord allow me to attain that?","Praise be to Allah.
Firstly:
Paradise has degrees or levels (we ask Allah to make us among its people), and Hell also has degrees or levels (we seek refuge with Allah from it). The people of Paradise will vary in their degrees or levels, according to the level of their faith and righteous deeds in this world. The best of them in knowledge, righteous deeds and faith will be the highest of them in the levels of Paradise.
The people in the lowest levels will not be able to attain what is in the highest levels, because they did not do that which makes them deserving of attaining those levels.
If all the people of Paradise were to share in the bliss that Allah has prepared for those who are above them, then there would be no wisdom in the variation of status and degree!
By Allah’s perfect justice, those who are deserving of Paradise will not all be the same in degree or level of bliss. Variation between people in this world in terms of faith and obedience leads to variation in their status and standing before Him, may He be glorified and exalted.
See the answer to question no. 126349.
 Secondly:
The people of Paradise will be in a state of eternal bliss, whether they are of the highest levels or less than that. There they will have whatever they wish for, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Gardens of perpetual residence, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow. They will have therein whatever they wish. Thus does Allah reward the righteous”
[an-Nahl 16:31]
“For them therein is whatever they wish, [while] abiding eternally. It is ever upon your Lord a promise [worthy to be] requested”
[al-Furqaan 25:16]
“Circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold. And therein is whatever the souls desire and [what] delights the eyes, and you will abide therein eternally”
[az-Zukhruf 43:71].
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“They will have therein whatever they wish” i.e., of pleasures, such as food, drink, clothing, dwellings, means of transportation, views and so on, such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has it ever crossed the mind of anyone.

They will never able to ask for any kind of delight that would bring them pleasure and great joy, but it will be granted to them. Hence Allah will give the people of Paradise what they wish for, to the extent that He will even prompt them to ask for some types of delight that never even occurred to them.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/101/where-zakaah-is-to-be-spent,Is a brother obliged to spend on his sister? Is it permissible for her to take zakaah from her brother’s wealth?.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    A brother is obliged to spend on his sister if she is poor 
    and he is independent of means and he would inherit from her if she died. If 
    he would not inherit from her because she has a son or because the father or 
    grandfather (father's father) is still alive, then he is not obliged to 
    spend on her and it is permissible to give her the zakaah of his wealth in 
    that case.
    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Mughni (8/169): 
    In order for maintenance to be obligatory, three conditions 
    must be met:

    (i)They should be poor and have no 
    wealth or source of income which would make them independent of being 
    maintained by others. If they have enough wealth or income to make them 
    independent of means, then it is not obligatory to spend on their 
    maintenance.

    (ii)The one who is obliged to spend 
    on their maintenance should have enough to do so, surplus to the costs of 
    his own maintenance, either from his wealth or his income. If he does not 
    have any surplus, then he is not obliged to do anything, because of the 
    report of Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “If one of you is poor, then let him start with himself. 
    If he has any surplus, then let him spend on his dependents, and if he has 
    any surplus, let him spend on his relatives.”

    (iii)The one who spends should be an 
    heir, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And on the 
    (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the 
    father)” [al-Baqarah 2:233]. And because there are ties of kinship between 
    those who would inherit from one another which dictate that the heir is more 
    entitled to the wealth of the one who leaves it behind than anyone else, so 
    by virtue of the ties of kinship he is to be singled out for maintenance 
    rather than anyone else. If he is not an heir, then he is not obliged to 
    spend on his maintenance. End quote.

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (13/503):
    The basic principle in our view is that it is essential that 
    the one who spends be an heir of the one on whom he spends, except for 
    direct ascendants and descendants, in which case the issue of inheritance is 
    not a condition. End quote.
    Based on this, if the brother is obliged to spend on his 
    sister, it is not permissible to give the zakaah of his wealth to her, but 
    if he is not obliged to spend on her, it is permissible to give the zakaah 
    of his wealth to her, and indeed that is better than giving it to someone 
    else who is not one of his relatives, because by doing this he will attain 
    the reward of both zakaah and upholding the ties of kinship.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/120/expiation,What is the ruling on one who forgets to make up missed fasts before the next Ramadaan comes?.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that forgetting is an 
    excuse which means that there is no sin or accountability in all matters, 
    because of a great deal of evidence in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, but they 
    differed as to whether the fidyah is still required in cases of 
    forgetfulness.
    With regard to the issue of forgetting to make up missed 
    Ramadaan fasts before the next Ramadaan comes, the scholars are also 
    unanimously agreed that they must still be made up after the second 
    Ramadaan, and they are not waived as a result of forgetting.
    But they differed as to whether the fidyah (which is feeding 
    a poor person) is required when making up the missed fast (after the second 
    Ramadaan has come and gone). There are two points of view:
    1 – That the fidyah is not required, because forgetting is an 
    excuse that means there is no sin and the fidyah is waived.
    This was the view of most of the Shaafa’is and some of the 
    Maalikis.
    See: Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj by Ibn Hajar al-Haytami 
    (3/445); Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (3/196); Minah al-Jaleel (2/154); 
    Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (2/263).
    2 – That the fidyah is required, and forgetting is an excuse 
    that means there is no sin only.
    This was the view of al-Khateeb al-Sharbeeni among the 
    Shaafa’is, who said in Mughni al-Muhtaaj (2/176):
    It seems that it means there is no sin only, and that the 
    fidyah is not waived.
    This was also stated by some of the Maalikis.
    See: Mawaahib al-Jaleel Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel 
    (2/450).
    The more correct view is the former, in sha Allaah, for three 
    reasons:
    1 – The general meaning of the verses and ahaadeeth which say 
    that people are not held accountable for forgetting, such as the verse in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]

    2 – The basic principle that one is not subject to any 
    expiation or fidyah except with evidence, and there is no reliable evidence 
    in this case.                                 

    3 – There is a difference of opinion as to whether this 
    fidyah is required in the first place, even in the case of one who delays 
    making up the fasts deliberately. The Hanafis and Zaahiris are of the view 
    that it is not obligatory and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was of the view that it 
    is only mustahabb, because there is no report to suggest that it is 
    prescribed except from the actions of some of the Sahaabah, which is not 
    strong enough to suggest that people be obliged to follow it, let alone 
    oblige them to do it in a case where Allaah has granted an excuse.
    See the answer to question no.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/213/love-of-allaah,"Does giving thanks when calamity strikes increase calamities, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: ‘If you give thanks, I will give you more (of My Blessings), but if you are thankless, verily! My Punishment is indeed severe’” [Ibraaheem 14:7]? And does giving praise mean the same as giving thanks?","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:
	Gratitude for calamities is mustahabb, because it is more 
	than merely accepting them.
	Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	With regard to the calamities that befall a person, that he 
	has no means of warding off, such as the death of someone who is dear to 
	him, the theft of his wealth, his own sickness, and the like, he may respond 
	to them in four ways:
	1.
	Helplessness 

	this means panicking, complaining and showing discontent. No 
	one does that but people with the least reason, religious commitment and 
	dignity.
	2.
	Showing patience

	either for the sake of Allah or for the sake of maintaining 
	human dignity
	3.
	Acceptance and contentment

	this is superior to patience, although there is a difference 
	of scholarly opinion as to whether it is obligatory or not, although the 
	scholars are agreed that patience is a must.
	4.
	Gratitude 

	this is superior to mere acceptance. In this case the 
	individual sees the calamity as a blessing, so he gives thanks to the One 
	Who is testing him for that test.
	End quote from ‘Iddat as-Saabireen (67)
	Al-Qaasimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	It should be noted that there is no worldly blessing but it 
	may be a calamity for some and a blessing for others. Poverty and sickness 
	may be good for one person, for if he were healthy and wealthy, he would 
	become an insolent transgressor. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
	(interpretation of the meaning):

	“And if Allah 
	were to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the 
	earth”

	[ash-Shoora 42:27]

	“Nay! Verily, 
	man does transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deed, etc.)

	Because he considers himself self-sufficient”

	[al-‘Alaq 96:6-7].
	The same may be applicable to one’s wife, children, relatives 
	and so on. Allah, may He be exalted, did not create anything but there is 
	wisdom and blessing in it.
	So among that which Allah, may He be exalted, has created 
	there are calamities, which may also be a blessing, either for the one who 
	is tested thereby, or for others. Therefore there is nothing that can be 
	described as a calamity in absolute terms, or as a blessing in absolute 
	terms. Therefore the individual has two duties in every situation: to be 
	patient and show gratitude.
	If you say: These are opposites, so how can they be combined 
	in one situation, because patience is only applicable in stressful 
	situations and gratitude is only applicable in happy situations? You should 
	understand that any one situation may be a cause of distress in one way and 
	a source of joy in another way, so one should exercise patience with regard 
	to that which causes distress and show gratitude for that which is a cause 
	for joy. In every situation of poverty, sickness, fear or calamity in this 
	world, there are five factors concerning which the wise person should 
	rejoice and for which he should give thanks:
	1.
	With regard to any calamity or sickness, one may think 
	that it could be even worse, because the decree of Allah, may He be exalted, 
	is limitless, so if Allah wanted to multiply it and increase it, what is 
	there that could stop or prevent Him? So let the individual give thanks that 
	it was not worse than that in this world.

	2.
	His calamity could have been with regard to his religious 
	commitment. According to the report: “O Allah, do not make our calamity in 
	our religious commitment.”

	3.
	There is no punishment but one could imagine that it 
	could have been delayed until the hereafter, and one may find consolation in 
	worldly calamities in many ways which would alleviate the calamity so that 
	its impact becomes less. But in contrast, the calamity of the hereafter 
	never ceases. So perhaps it is the case that his punishment has not been 
	delayed until the hereafter, and has been hastened in this world, so why 
	should he not give thanks to Allah for that?

	4.
	This calamity and test was decreed for him in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, 
	so it was inevitable that it should reach him and it has done so. And now it 
	is over and he is relieved from some or all of the calamities that were 
	decreed for him, so it is a blessing.

	5.
	The reward thereof is greater than the calamity itself. 
	The calamities of this world are paths to the hereafter, and every worldly 
	calamity is like a remedy that may cause pain in the short term, but is 
	ultimately beneficial.

	Whoever realises that, it is expected of him to give thanks 
	for calamities, and whoever does not recognise these blessings in calamities 
	is not expected to give thanks, because gratitude is connected to 
	recognition of the blessing. Whoever does not believe that the reward for 
	calamity is greater and better than the calamity itself cannot be expected 
	to give thanks for the calamity.
	Moreover, in spite of the fact that there is blessing in 
	calamities, the Prophet (blessings in the peace of Allah be upon him) used 
	to seek refuge with Allah in his supplication from the calamities of this 
	world and the punishment of the hereafter, and he used to seek refuge with 
	Allah from the rejoicing of his enemies in his misfortune, and so on. In his 
	supplication, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “And Your 
	keeping me safe and sound from calamity is dearer to me.” 

	End quote from Tahdheeb Maw‘izat al-Mu’mineen 
	(287-288)
	Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	In their response to calamities, people fall into many 
	ranks:
	1.
	One who is grateful

	2.
	One who shows acceptance and contentment

	3.
	One who is patient

	4.
	One who panics.

	As for the one who panics, he is doing something that is 
	prohibited and is expressing discontent with the decree of the Lord of the 
	Worlds, in Whose hand is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, His 
	is the dominion and He does whatever He wills.
	As for the one who is patient, he is doing that which is 
	obligatory. The one who is patient is the one who puts up with calamity. In 
	other words, he finds it bitter and difficult and hard, and he dislikes it 
	befalling him, but he puts up with it and restrains himself from saying or 
	doing anything that is prohibited. This is what is obligatory.
	As for the one who shows acceptance and contentment, he is 
	the one who does not worry about this calamity, for he sees that it is from 
	Allah, so he accepts it with complete acceptance and feels no sorrow or 
	regret in his heart, because he is completely content. His situation is 
	better than that of the one who is merely patient.
	As for the one who is grateful, he gives thanks to Allah for 
	this calamity.
	But how can he give thanks to Allah for this calamity, when 
	it is a calamity?
	The answer is twofold:
	Firstly, he looks at those who are afflicted with a greater 
	calamity, and he gives thanks to Allah that he has not been afflicted with 
	such a level of calamity.
	Secondly, he realises that this calamity has befallen him as 
	expiation for his bad deeds and to raise him in status, if he is patient, 
	and what awaits him in the hereafter is better than what is in this world, 
	so he gives thanks to Allah. Moreover, those who are most sorely tested 
	among the people are Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best, then 
	the next best. So he hopes that he is one of the righteous, and he gives 
	thanks to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for this blessing.
	Giving thanks for calamities is mustahabb, because it is 
	superior to acceptance, for gratitude includes acceptance and more.
	End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (5/395-396)
	Secondly:
	Giving thanks for calamity does not lead to further calamity, 
	because the words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the 
	meaning), “And 
	(remember) when your Lord proclaimed: ‘If you give thanks, I will give you 
	more” [Ibraaheem 14:7], 
	only refer to giving thanks for blessings, not giving thanks for calamities, 
	based on the fact that Allah says after that: “but 
	if you are thankless, verily! My Punishment is indeed severe.”

	As-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
	“And 
	(remember) when your Lord proclaimed” 
	that is, announced and promised

	“If you 
	give thanks, I will give you more” 
	blessings

	“but if 
	you are thankless, verily! My Punishment is indeed severe” 
	– and part of that is that He will take away from you the blessings that He 
	had bestowed upon you. Giving thanks or showing gratitude means 
	acknowledging Allah’s blessings in one’s heart, praising Allah for them, and 
	using them in ways that please Allah, may He be exalted. Thanklessness or 
	ingratitude for blessings is the opposite of that.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/176/apostasy,"With regard to the Muslim who impugns the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in secret and conceals that: if he repents before he is executed, will Allah accept his repentance so that he becomes a Muslim, because he had become a kaafir? Or does he have to announce what he did so that he will be executed before Allah will accept his return to Islam?","Praise be to Allah.
Firstly: 
Testifying that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah is one of the pillars of Islam. The Muslims are commanded to venerate and love their Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he is deserving of that, because of the lofty status he has before Allah, and because of the favours he has done to this ummah, for he was the cause of their being brought out of their state of ignorance and he was the cause of their attaining all that is good. How could any Muslim have the audacity, in spite of that, to impugn the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? 
Hence the scholars are unanimously agreed that the one who impugns the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is a kaafir and apostate who has gone beyond the pale of Islam. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Impugning Allah or impugning His Messenger is kufr both inwardly and outwardly, regardless of whether the one who does that believes that it is haraam or he thinks that it is permissible for him, or he was not thinking of the ruling when he did that. This is the view of the fuqaha’ and all of Ahl as-Sunnah who say that faith is comprised of both words and deeds. 
As-Saarim al-Maslool, 1/513 
It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (40/61): 
The Holy Qur’an tells us that it is a grave sin to disparage the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or belittle him, and the one who does that is cursed. That is in the verses in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger (SAW) Allah has cursed them in this world, and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating torment”
[al-Ahzaab 33:57]
“If you ask them (about this), they declare: We were only talking idly and joking. Say: Was it at Allah and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (SAW) that you were mocking? 
Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.)”
[at-Tawbah 9:65-66].
The fuqaha’ are of the view that the one who does any of these things is to be regarded as a kaafir. End quote. 
It also says (22/184): 
The ruling on the one who impugns him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is that he is an apostate, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. End quote. 
If the one who impugns the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is an apostate, then the punishment prescribed for him in sharee‘ah is execution; there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning that. 
Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The majority of scholars are agreed that the one who impugns the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is to be executed. End quote. 
See: Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 8/82 
Al-Khattaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
I do not know of any of the Muslims who differed concerning the obligation of executing him. End quote. 
Ma‘aalim as-Sunan, 3/295 
Secondly: 
If the one who impugned the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) repents and regrets what he did, and he comes back to Islam, that repentance will benefit him in his relationship with Allah. So before Allah he will be a believing Muslim. But with regard to his execution, the obligation of executing him will not be waived. So he will be killed as a Muslim, and he should be washed, the funeral prayer should be offered for him, he may be inherited from and he should be buried in the Muslim graveyard. As for the apostate who did not come back to Islam, he is to be executed as a kaafir. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Will the repentance of one who impugned Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, or who reviled the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) be accepted? 
He replied: 
There is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning that, and there are two opinions: 
(i)
The first opinion is that repentance will not be accepted from the one who impugned Allah or His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). This is the well-known view of the Hanbalis. Rather he is to be executed as a kaafir, and the funeral prayer is not to be offered for him and supplication is not to be offered for mercy for him, and he is to be buried in a place far away from the Muslim graves. 
(ii)
The second opinion is that the repentance of one who had reviled Allah or His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will be accepted if it is known that he has sincerely repented to Allah, and he admits that he made a mistake and speaks of Allah, may He be exalted, in a way that reflects the veneration He deserves. This is because of the general meaning of the evidence that indicates that repentance is accepted, such as the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins” [al-Zumar 39:53]. There are some of the kuffaar who impugn Allah, yet despite that their repentance is accepted. This is the correct view. The repentance of one who impugned the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is accepted, but he must be executed. This is unlike the one who impugns Allah; his repentance is accepted but he is not to be executed, because Allah has told us that He forgives transgressions against His rights if the person repents, and that He forgives all sins. As for the one who impugns the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), there are two matters to be taken into consideration: 
(a)The first is a shar‘i matter, because he is the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). From this angle, he repentance will be accepted if he repents.
(b)The second is a personal matter. From this nagle, repentance will not be accepted, because it has to do with the right of a human being, and it is not known whether he would forgive it. On that basis he is to be executed, but if he is executed, we should wash him, shroud him, offer the funeral prayer for him and bury him with the Muslims.
This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, who wrote a book on that entitled as-Saarim al-Maslool fi Tahattum Qatli Saabb ar-Rasool. That is because he has transgressed against the rights of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). By the same token, if he were to slander the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he is to be executed and not flogged. 
If it is asked: Has it not been proven that some of the people impugned the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) during his lifetime and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted their repentance? 
The answer is: This is true, but that was during his lifetime (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he waived what was due to him. But after his death, no one has the right to waive what is due to him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So we must do what is required if he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is impugned, which is to execute the one who impugns him and to believe that the repentance of the one who does that is accepted with regard to the relationship between that person and Allah, may He be exalted. 
If it is asked: If it was possible that he (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) would let him off if that happened during his lifetime, doesn’t that dictate that we should refrain from passing judgement on him? 
My response is: That does not dictate that we should refrain, because evil has occurred by his impugning him, and it is not known whether the effect of that impugning will be removed; the basic principle is that it remains. 
If it is asked: Wasn’t it usually the case that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) let off those who impugned him? 
My response is: Yes indeed, and perhaps letting them off during the lifetime of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was done to serve a purpose, which was to soften people’s hearts towards Islam, as he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) knew the identities of the hypocrites but he did not execute them, “lest people say that Muhammad kills his companions.” But nowadays if we know that a specific individual is one of the hypocrites, we should execute him. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Refraining from killing a known hypocrite was only done during the lifetime of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). End quote. 
Majmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen, 2/150-152 
But… So long as the matter has not reached the qaadi (judge), what is prescribed is for the Muslim to conceal himself (his sins) and not go to the judge to confess his crime; rather he should strive hard to repent and seek forgiveness, and do a lot of good deeds, so that Allah will forgive him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, I am indeed Forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them, (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
“Then, verily! Your Lord for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to Allah) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[an-Nahl 16:119].

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/184/rulings-on-sport-leisure-and-entertainment,Did the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) engage in recreational activities? Or was his entire life filled with acts of obedience and worship?,"Praise
      be to Allah.

      Yes: the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to engage 
      in recreational activities, yet his entire life was devoted for Allah, the 
      Lord of the Worlds, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says 
      (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad (blessings and peace

      living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Worlds” [al-An ‘aam 
      6:162].
    His noble life was all for the sake of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him). As for worship, it was obviously for the sake of Allah.
    With regard to matters other than worship, the Prophet (blessings and peace 
    of Allah be upon him) used to race with ‘Aa’ishah, and he used to joke with 
    his family, treat them kindly and chat with them at night.
    Muslim (670), Abu Dawood (1294) and an-Nasaa’i (1358) narrated from Jaabir 
    ibn Samurah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be 
    upon him) would not get up from the place in which he had prayed Fajr until 
    the sun had risen, and when the sun had risen he would get up. They used to 
    chat and talk about matters of the Jaahiliyah, and they would laugh but he 
    smiled..
    At-Tirmidhi (1990) narrated – and classed the report as saheeh – that Abu 
    Hurayrah said: They said: O Messenger of Allah, you joke with us. He said:

    Ibn Maajah (144) narrated from Ya‘la ibn Murrah that they had gone out with 
    the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to a meal to which 
    they had been invited, and there was al-Husayn playing in the street. The 
    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came in front of the 
    people and stretched out his hands, and the child started to run here and 
    there. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made him laugh

It 
    was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that a man from among the desert people –

    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Messenger of Allah 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would equip him if he wanted to 
    go out (on campaign). The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him) said: “Zaahir is our man of the desert, and we are his people 
    of the city.”
    The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to him when he 
    was selling his merchandise, and embraced him from behind. The man did not 
    see him, and he said: Let me go! Who is this? Then he turned to face him and 
    when he realised that it was the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
    upon him), he placed his back against his chest. The Messenger of Allah 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Who will buy this slave?” 
    Zaahir said: O Messenger of Allah, you will find me unsellable. He said: 
    “But with Allah, you are not unsellable”; or he (blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him) said: “But with Allah you are valuable.”

    Islam came to close the doors that lead to evil and sin, and 
    is keen to block all the means that may lead to corruption of hearts and 
    minds. Love and infatuation between the sexes are among the worst of 
    problems.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/129):
    Love is a psychological sickness, and if it grows strong it 
    affects the body, and becomes a physical sickness, either as diseases of the 
    brain, which are said to be diseases caused by waswaas, or diseases of the 
    body such as weakness, emaciation and so on. End quote.
    And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ 
    al-Fataawa (10/132):
    Loving a non-mahram woman leads to many negative 
    consequences, the full extent of which is known only to the Lord of people. 
    It is a sickness that affects the religious commitment of the sufferer, then 
    it may also affect his mind and body. End quote.
    It is sufficient to note that one of the effects of love of a 
    member of the opposite sex is enslavement of the heart which is held captive 
    to the loved one. So love is a door that leads to humiliation and servility. 
    That is sufficient to put one off this sickness.
    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/185):
    If a man is in love with a woman, even if she is permissible 
    for him, his heart remains enslaved to her, and she can control him as she 
    wishes, even though outwardly he appears to be her master, because he is her 
    husband; but in fact he is her prisoner and slave, especially if she is 
    aware of his need and love for her. In that case, she will control him like 
    a harsh and oppressive master controls his abject slave who cannot free 
    himself from him. Rather he is worse off than that, because enslavement of 
    the heart is worse than enslavement of the body. End quote.
    Attachment to the opposite sex will not happen to a heart 
    that is filled with love of Allaah; it only affects a heart that is empty 
    and weak, so it is able to gain control of it, then when it becomes strong 
    and powerful it is able to defeat the love of Allaah and lead the person 
    into shirk. Hence it is said: Love is the action of an empty heart.
    If the heart is devoid of the love and remembrance of the 
    Most Merciful, and is a stranger to speaking to Him, it will be filled with 
    love of women, images and listening to music.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/135):
    If the heart loves Allaah alone and is sincerely devoted to 
    Him, it will not even think of loving anyone else in the first place, let 
    alone falling in love. When a heart falls in love, that is due to the lack 
    of love for Allaah alone. Hence because Yoosuf loved Allaah and was 
    sincerely devoted to Him, he did not fall into the trap of love, rather 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and 
    illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our chosen, (guided) 
    slaves”

    [Yoosuf 12:24]

    As for the wife of al-‘Azeez, she was a mushrik as were her 
    people, hence she fell into this trap. End quote.
    The Muslim must save himself from this fate and not fall 
    short in guarding against it and ridding himself of it. If he falls short in 
    that regard and follows the path of love, by continuing to steal haraam 
    glances or listening to haraam things, and being careless in the way he 
    speaks to the opposite sex, etc, then he is affected by love as a result, 
    then he is sinning and will be subject to punishment for his 
    actions.                                                                                                 
    

    How many people have been careless at the beginning of this 
    problem, and thought that they were able to rid themselves of it whenever 
    they wanted, or that they could stop at a certain limit and not go any 
    further, until the sickness took a strong hold and no doctor or remedy could 
    help?
    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Rawdat al-Muhibbeen (147):
    If the cause happens by his choice, he has no excuse for the 
    consequences that are beyond his control, but if the reason is haraam, the 
    drunkard had no excuse. Undoubtedly following one glance with another and 
    allowing oneself to keep thinking about the person is like drinking 
    intoxicants: he is to be blamed for the cause. End quote. 
    If a person strives to keep away from the things that lead to 
    this serious sickness, by lowering his gaze and not looking at haraam 
    things, not listening to haraam things, and averting the passing thoughts 
    that the shaytaan casts into his mind, then after that something of the 
    evils of this sickness befalls him because of a passing glance or a 
    transaction that is basically permissible, and his heart becomes attached to 
    a woman, there is no sin on him for that in sha Allaah, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]

    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (11/10):
    If that does not result from carelessness or transgression on 
    his part, then there is no sin on him for what befalls him. End quote.
    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Rawdat al-Muhibbeen (147):
    If love occurs for a reason that is not haraam, the person is 
    not to be blamed, such as one who loved his wife or slave woman, then he 
    separated from her but the love remained and did not leave him. He is not to 
    be blamed for that. Similarly if there was a sudden glance then he averted 
    his gaze, but love took hold of his heart without him meaning it to, he 
    must, however, ward it off and resist it. End quote.
    But he must treat his heart by putting a stop to the effects 
    of this love, and by filling his heart with love of Allaah and seeking His 
    help in that. He should not feel too shy to consult intelligent and 
    trustworthy people for advice or consult some doctors and psychologists, 
    because he may find some remedy with them. In doing that he must be patient, 
    seek reward, remain chaste and  keep quiet, and Allaah will decree reward 
    for him in sha Allaah.
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/133):
    If he is tested with love but he remains chaste and is 
    patient, then he will be rewarded for fearing Allaah. It is known from 
    shar’i evidence that if a person remains chaste and avoids haraam things in 
    looking, word and deeds, and he keeps quiet about it and does not speak of 
    it, so that there will be haraam talk about that, whether by complaining to 
    another person or committing evil openly, or pursuing the beloved one in any 
    way, and he is patient in obeying Allaah and avoiding sin, despite the pain 
    of love that he feels in his heart, just as one who is afflicted with a 
    calamity bears the pain of it with patience, then he will be one of those 
    who fear Allaah and are patient, “Verily, he who fears Allaah with 
    obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing 
    righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the 
    reward of the Muhsinoon (good‑doers) to be lost” [Yoosuf 12:90]. End

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/140/vows,What is the ruling on breaking the oath when one is not able to fulfil it? What is the ruling if fulfilling the oath conflicts with honouring one's parents?.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    Firstly:
    The oath that one swears and resolves to do must be fulfilled 
    by doing what one swore to do or refraining from what one swore to refrain 
    from. If he does not do that, then he must offer kafaarat yameen (expiation 
    for breaching an oath). Expiation for breaking an oath has been discussed in 
    detail in the answer to question number
    45676.
    Secondly:
    If fulfilling an oath conflicts with honouring one's parents, 
    then precedence must be given to honouring one's parents, and one must break 
    the oath and offer expiation, so long as there is no sin involved in doing 
    so.
    Muslim (1650) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath then sees that something else is 
    better than it, let him do that and offer expiation for his oath.”
    Al-Nawawi said: 
    In these hadeeths there is evidence that if a person swears 
    to do something or not to do something, and breaking the oath is better than 
    fulfilling the oath, it is mustahabb for him to break it but he must offer 
    expiation. This is agreed upon. End quote.
    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/124:
    If you swear by Allah not to take something in the future, 
    then this is regarded as an oath that one must adhere to if adhering to it 
    is an act of obedience to Allah. But if adhering to it is an act of 
    disobedience to Allah and His Messenger, or you think that something else is 
    better than it, then you may break your oath by doing something that is 
    contrary to what you swore to do. End quote.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/7/belief-in-divinely-revealed-books,Were the Zaboor and the Scripture of Ibraaheem distorted?,"Praise be to Allah.
Firstly:
Allah, may He be exalted, revealed a Scripture to Ibraaheem, as He, may He be exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed, this is in the former scriptures,
The scriptures of Abraham and Moses”
[al-A‘laa 87:18-19].
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has told us in His holy Book about some of what was in the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses
And [of] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations] – 
That no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another
And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives
And that his effort is going to be seen
Then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense… ”
[an-Najm 53:36-40 … until the end of the soorah].
Similar to that is the well-known verses at the end of Soorat al-A‘laa, which are quoted above.
What is required of us is only to believe in general terms in the Scriptures that Allah, may He be exalted, sent down to His Prophet Moosaa (peace be upon him), and to believe in whatever is proven to us to be sound through the revelation sent to the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in which there are lessons and exhortations. As for anything more than that, such as details of what those Scriptures contained, we are not obliged to know it and we have no way of knowing it or finding out about its details. Trying to find out about that is taking on something that cannot be proven, and we have no need of that according to the teachings of our religion, for Allah has perfected our religion for us and is pleased with Islam for us as our religion.
We know of no religious text that suggests that the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is still extant, or that the knowledge contained therein reached any of the people of Islam in such a manner that it can be proven and relied upon.
What appears to be the case is that its knowledge was abrogated a long time ago and was lost to people.
In fact, this is applicable to the books of the Children of Israel, namely the Torah and the Gospel; there is no longer anything that can be authenticated in that which is extant among them, except for that which is confirmed by Islamic religious texts. As for everything other than that, the most that can be said is that we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.
If this is the case with regard to the books of the Children of Israel, despite the large numbers of people who venerate them, pay attention to them and refer to them, then it is even more likely that this is the case with regard to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). The most can be said about what is extant among people of that, that is attributed to the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), is that it is like the Scriptures and Books of the Children of Israel: we neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it.
For more information, see the answers to questions no. 199116 and 126004.
Secondly:
With regard to the Zaboor of Dawood (peace be upon him), it is the Book that Allah revealed to him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the book [of Psalms [Zaboor]]” [al-Israa’ 17:55].
The word zaboor refers to something written. Tafseer at-Tabari (6/17).
At-Taahir said:
It is the name for the collected sayings of Daawood (peace be upon him) – some of which are words that were revealed to him, and some are words with which he was inspired, words of supplication and conversing with Allah. It is the book that is known nowadays as the Book of Psalms in the Old Testament.
End quote from at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer (15/138).
The scholars have stated that the Zaboor of Dawood contained words of praise and glorification of Allah, may He be exalted; it did not contain any rulings on what is lawful and what is prohibited (halaal and haraam), or on shares of inheritance or hudood punishments. See Tafseer at-Tabari (14/625).
Al-Qurtubi said: The Zaboor is the book of Dawood. It contained one hundred and fifty chapters, in which there were no rulings or statements of what is lawful and what is prohibited; rather it was words of wisdom and exhortation.
There are references to the contents of the Zaboor and the Scripture of Ibraaheem in some reports which are not proven.
In the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) it says:
I said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Ibraaheem?
He said: “It was all proverbs, such as:
O powerful and arrogant king, I did not appoint you to pile up worldly gains one on top of another; rather I appointed you to avert from Me the supplication of the one who has been wronged, for I do not reject it even if it comes from a disbeliever.
Every rational individual, unless he loses his mind, must have certain times: a time in which he converses with his Lord, a time in which he takes stock of himself, a time in which he reflects upon the creation of Allah, and a time in which he focuses on meeting his need for food and drink.
Every rational individual should not focus his mind except on three things: seeking provision for the hereafter [by doing righteous deeds], working to earn a living, and finding pleasure in something that is not prohibited.
The intelligent man should have insight into the era in which he lives, focus on his own affairs and guard his tongue.
Whoever regards his words as being among his deeds will speak little and will only speak about what concerns him.”
I [Abu Dharr] said: O Messenger of Allah, what was the Scripture of Moosa?
He said: “It was all exhortations:
I am astounded by the one who is certain of death, for how can he rejoice?
I am astounded by the one who is certain of the Fire, for how can he laugh?
I am astounded by the one who is certain of the divine decree, for how can he strive too hard?
I am astounded by the one who sees this world and its vicissitudes, for how can he be at ease with it?
I am astounded by the one who is certain of the reckoning tomorrow, for how can he not strive?”
This hadith was narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (361) and others. Al-Arnaa’oot said in his comments on the book of Ibn Hibbaan: Its isnad is da‘eef jiddan (very weak). The same was stated by Shaykh al-Albaani in ad-Da‘eefah. See Tafseer Ibn Katheer (2/472).
What we have stated above about the Scripture of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) with regard to how authentic it is and the extent to which we may trust its contents, we may also state with regard to the Zaboor, because we have no report to indicate that it has survived. Whatever has been transmitted of it via the People of the Book comes under the same ruling as the Israa’eeliyyaat (reports narrated from Jewish sources), which are of three categories:

Acceptable: this refers to that which is known to be sound due to its having been soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).
That concerning which no verdict is given: this refers to that for which it cannot be known whether it is valid or false. It is permissible to narrate reports of this category for the purpose of exhortation and admonition, but we do not believe that it is either sound or false, in compliance with the command of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).
Rejected: this refers to that which is known to be false, and it is not appropriate to believe it, accept it or narrate it.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/196/medicine-and-medical-treatments,"I feel very embarrassed to ask this question. But there should not be shyness in Islam. There is a religious God-fearing sister I know who is married and has children. This sister says that she does not enjoy the intimate relationship sometimes with her husband, because he has a small penis. She asks: Is it permissible to ask her husband to use some medication or machine to enlarge the size of his penis? She saw some advertisements in pharmacies and on the internet about this matter. Should she ask him to use an artificial penis on his penis so that she enjoys, then take it out for him to enjoy as well?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    Firstly: 
There is nothing wrong with 
    the husband referred to here consulting doctors for a prescription that will 
    enlarge his penis, so long as there are no harmful side effects. 
There is nothing wrong with 
    him using something that is placed over his penis, such as a condom and the 
    like, if that will make his wife’s pleasure more complete, because the basic 
    principle is that it is permissible and the husband is required to treat his 
    wife well, which includes keeping his wife chaste and fulfilling her 
    desires, and removing any obstacles that might prevent that. 
Secondly: 
Your saying “There is no 
    shyness in religion” is not appropriate. It would be better for you to say 
    that Allaah is not shy to speak the truth. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said in one of his answers: As for you saying 
    “There is no shyness in religion,” it is better to say that Allaah is not 
    shy to speak the truth, as Umm Sulaym (may Allaah have mercy on her) said: 
    “O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah is not shy to speak the truth. Does a woman 
    have to do ghusl if she has a wet dream?” As for saying “there is no shyness 
    in religion”, this is based on a misunderstanding of the proper meaning. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Shyness is 
    part of faith.” So shyness in religion is part of faith, but when someone 
    says “There is no shyness in religion,” what he means is that there is no 
    shyness in matters of religion, i.e., in asking about something concerning 
    which one may feel shy. If this is what is meant, then it is better to say 
    that Allaah is not shy to speak the truth. Al-Liqa’ al-Shahri (37/25)

    Al-Bukhaari (314) and Muslim (332) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) that Asma’ asked the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about ghusl following menses. He said: 
    “Let one of you take her water and lotus leaves and clean herself well, then 
    let her pour water over her head and rub it vigorously so that it will reach 
    the roots of her hair. Then let her pour the water over herself, then take a 
    piece of cloth scented with musk and purify herself.” Asma’ said: How should 
    she purify herself? He said: “Subhaan-Allaah! Purify yourself with it.” 
    ‘Aa’ishah said – as if she whispered it to her – Follow the traces of 
    blood.
    The reason for using this is to perfume the site and ward off 
    unpleasant odours.
    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh 
    Muslim: The scholars differed concerning the reason for using musk. The 
    correct view is that of the majority of our companions and others, which is 
    that the purpose of using musk is to perfume the site and ward off 
    unpleasant odours. … She should use it after ghusl. If no musk is available, 
    she should use whatever perfume she can find. If she cannot find any perfume 
    then it is mustahabb for her to use whatever will remove the odour [soap, 
    nowadays]. If she cannot find anything, then water is sufficient for her, 
    but if she fails to perfume it when perfume is available, that is makrooh. 
    If she is not able to do it then it is not makrooh in her case. End quote.
    Dr. Aaminah ‘Ali Naasir Siddeeq, professor of microbiology in

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/104/charitable-donations-for-the-sake-of-allah,"I hope that you can advise me about this method that I follow every day and that I learned from one of my friends; it is a very easy way of giving charity every day.
What I do is put a box for money, and every day I put whatever I can in it, of any amount, even if usually it is very small, equivalent to one Saudi riyal (to explain to you how much it is). And I form the intention to give charity as well as reciting whatever I want of du‘aa’, and I do not forget to ask Allah to regard it as charity on my behalf and on behalf of all the Muslim men and women and believing men and women, both living and dead, in sha Allah.
Is this daily charity permissible and is it regarded as acceptable and a suitable amount?

Can I change it for bills or notes of an equivalent amount in order to have more room in the box and use these small amounts again? 
Is it permissible to collect it and give it in charity to a needy person in one go?.","Praise be to Allaah.
    
    Firstly:

    It is mustahabb to give charity to one who is in need, even 
    if it is something small, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him) said: “Protect yourselves from the Fire even if it is with half 
    a date.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5564; Muslim, 1689
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever gives charity the equivalent of a date that was acquired by 
    halaal means – for Allah does not accept anything but that which is good 
    (halaal)– Allah accepts it in His right hand, then He tends it for the one 
    who gave it, as one of you tends his foal, until it becomes like a 
    mountain.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1321
    Secondly:
    Reciting du‘aa’ before giving charity is something that is 
    subject to further discussion. This has been discussed previously in the 
    answer to question no. 98579.
    Thirdly:
    It is permissible for a person to give in charity on his own 
    behalf and to intend that others among those who have died have a share of 
    the reward of his charity. This has been discussed in the answer to question 
    no. 102322.
    With regard to giving a share of the reward for the charity 
    to those who are still alive, this is not mentioned in the Sunnah so it is 
    better not to do it.
    It says in Zaad al-Mustaqni‘: If a person does any act 
    of worship and dedicates its reward to a deceased Muslim, or one who is 
    still living, that will benefit him. End quote.
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

    If a person has died, and one does an act of worship on his 
    behalf, that serves a purpose, because the deceased is in need (of hasanaat) 
    but cannot do any righteous deeds. But if he is alive and is able to do this 
    act, then in that case it depends, because it may lead to the living person 
    depending on this man who is doing an act of worship on his behalf. There is 
    no report that the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) or the 
    righteous early generations did such a thing; rather what they were 
    accustomed to do was to dedicate the reward for an act of worship to the 
    dead; in the case of those who were still alive, they did not do this, 
    except in the case of an obligation such as Hajj, because that was known 
    from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), but 
    that is subject to the condition that the person on whose behalf Hajj is 
    performed is incapable in such a way that there is no hope of recovery.

    End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘, 5/371
    Fourthly:
    There is nothing wrong with exchanging pieces of metal for 
    others; rather it is permissible for you to change your mind about this 
    charity, because anything that is given as charity or a gift does not become 
    the property of the recipients unless they take possession of it. If it has 
    not been taken possession of, then the giver has the option to go ahead with 
    it or to change his mind concerning it. See the answer to question no.
    146237
    Fifthly:
    The one who wants to give charity has a choice between giving 
    it to one poor person or more, as he sees fit. It is better to give it to 
    relatives if they are in need, because Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “To an orphan near of kin” [al-Balad 90:15].
    And because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) said: “Charity given to the poor person is charity, but given to a 
    relative it is two things: charity and upholding ties of kinship.”

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/223/manners,"What is the ruling on writing Bismillaah il-Rahmaan il-Raheem at the beginning of articles, reports, stories and poems?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    
    If the subject matter of the articles, reports, stories and 
    poems is good, such as calling people to adhere to Islam and good attitudes 
    and the like, or the subject matter is permissible and is free of haraam and 
    evil things, there is nothing wrong with starting them with the Basmalah, 
    rather that should be done, seeking blessing by mentioning the name of 
    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and following the example of the 
    Holy Qur’aan, for Allaah started it with the Basmalah.
    But if the subject matter of these articles, reports, stories 
    and poems is haraam, then it is not permissible to write them or publish 
    them, and it is not permissible to read them except for one who will 
    denounce the falsehood contained in them; and it is not permissible to write 
    Bismillaah il-Rahmaan il-Raheem at the beginning of them, because mentioning 
    the name of Allaah, may He be exalted, in the context of something sinful is 
    contrary to the respect and veneration of Allaah that is enjoined, and it 
    may even lead to a kind of disrespect and mocking the name of Allaah, may He 
    be exalted.
    Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said: 
    Anything that is haraam or makrooh, whether it is words or 
    actions, it is not permissible to start it with any mention of Allaah, may 
    He be exalted, because that is disrespectful, and is starting sin with an 
    act of obedience.
    An example of that is writing the Basmalah at the top of a 
    poem that is not good, or at the beginning of a haraam game, or a haraam 
    bet, or starting a misguided program with recitation of the Qur’aan or with 
    praising Allaah or sending blessings and peace upon the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and so on.
    The people have gone so far in messing about and deceiving 
    the simple-minded people by giving the impression that these haraam things 
    are permissible, and it has got so bad that they do a prostration for sin 
    when one betting party wins over another, the winner prostrates for winning 
    the haraam bet! This prostration is something that incurs the wrath and 
    anger of Allaah. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek. 
    It was narrated that Mak-hool al-Azdi said: I said to Ibn 
    ‘Umar: What do you think if the murderer, drinker, thief and adulterer 
    remember Allaah? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Therefore 
    remember Me (by praying, glorifying). I will remember you” [al-Baqarah 
    2:152]. He said: If such a person remembers Allaah, Allaah will remember 
    him by cursing him until he falls silent.
    Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir (may Allaah have mercy on him) commented 
    on this report in ‘Umdat al-Tafseer (1/273) where he said: What Ibn 
    ‘Umar said is true, and applies fully to what the evildoers and promiscuous 
    people do nowadays, when they remember Allaah at times of committing evil 
    and in evil and immoral songs and acting, which they claim are educational, 
    and in their fabricated stories, which they regard as literature, and in 
    their toying with religion which they call religious poetry and nasheed, and 
    they sing these nasheeds at times when they should show dignity and devotion 
    to worship, to the point that they have confused the masses with regard to 
    the rituals of Islam. All of them mention Allaah but Allaah will mention 
    them by cursing them until they fall silent. End quote from Tas-heeh

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/31/quraanic-exegesis,"Does the word nikaah in the Qur’an always refer to the marriage contract? Or does it refer to both the marriage contract and intercourse? I have read that Ibn Taymiyah said that if the context is enjoining it, then it refers to both the marriage contract and intercourse, and if the context is forbidding it, then it refers to one of them.","Praise be to Allah.
This is an issue that was discussed at length by the scholars of tafseer, and this is not the place to discuss all aspects of this matter in detail.
The correct view concerning this matter is that the usage of the word “nikaah” in the religious texts – that is, the way it is used in the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the way the Sahaabah used the word – more often refers to the marriage contract.
However, that does not mean that it is not used to refer to intercourse – or in a more general sense, embracing and the like. There is no stronger proof than the fact that it is used frequently and is well-known to refer to one of the two things.
The word most often refers to the marriage contract in the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the usage of the Sahaabah, and even among the Arabs before Islam. This is clear and there is no need for any circumstantial evidence to understand it.
See the entry on the word nikaah:
http://fiqh.islammessage.com/NewsDetails.aspx?id=4058
Ibn Taymiyah said: Whenever the word nikaah occurs in the Qur’an, it inevitably refers to the marriage contract, although the meaning of intercourse is also included in it.
As for this word referring to intercourse only, that does not occur in the Book of Allah at all.
End quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra (3/178).
He refuted at length those who claimed that the word nikaah in the Qur’an refers to intercourse only.
Ibn al-Qayyim said: The word nikaah in the Qur’an can only refer to both the marriage contract and intercourse together. As for it meaning intercourse only, that does not occur in the Qur’an even once.
But when there is a word that may have two meanings, then in the context of prohibition it may apply to either of them, in contrast to the context of enjoining it, in which case it applies to both meanings. Therefore you will not be complying with the prohibition unless you refrain from both, and you will not be complying with the command unless you do both.
The words (interpretation of the meaning) “And do not marry those [women] whom your fathers married” [an-Nisaa’ 4:22] imply that it is forbidden for a person to marry a woman with whom his father did the marriage contract but did not consummate the marriage with her, and that it is forbidden for him to marry a woman with whom his father had intercourse but did not do the marriage contract with her.
The words (interpretation of the meaning) “then marry those that please you of [other] women” [an-Nisaa’ 4:3], “And marry the unmarried among you” [an-Noor 24:32] and “So marry them with the permission of their people” [an-Nisaa’ 4:25] do not refer to the marriage contract without intercourse, or intercourse without a marriage contract; rather they refer to both together.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/258/psychological-and-social-problems,"Are there any signs before a person dies, whether he is a believer or a disbeliever? Are there any specific times for those signs?

If it becomes apparent to him that his death is approaching, what should he do? When should we pay attention to these signs if there is such a thing?

Is there any way to reduce the agonies of death?

What are the best righteous deeds that one may be advised to adhere to?","Praise
      be to Allah.

    Firstly: 
No 
    one knows exactly when he will die, or in what land he will die. Allah, may 
    He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Verily, Allah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the 
    Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No 
    person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he 
    will die. Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things)”

    [Luqmaan 31:34].
    See also the answers to questions no. 100451 and
    180876
    Secondly:
    There are no specific signs by which a person may know that his death and 
    the end of his life are approaching. This is by the mercy of Allah towards 
    His slaves, for if a person knew when he was going to die, and he knew that 
    repentance expiates the sins that come before it, perhaps he might indulge 
    in sins and commit evil deeds, and promise himself that one hour before his 
    death he will repent and give up his sin. But such a person does not deserve 
    to be a slave of Allah; rather he is a slave to his whims and desires.
    This is in contrast to reality, for no person knows when he will die, so the 
    wise person strives to make up what he has missed out on and hastens to do 
    so by repenting and doing righteous deeds, for he does not know when his 
    life will end, and he remains in this state until Allah takes his soul. Such 
    a person deserves to be a righteous slave who loves to obey Allah and hates 
    to disobey Him.
    But there are some signs which may indicate that the end of a person’s life 
    is approaching, such as if he suffers a severe sickness from which people 
    hardly ever recover. The same applies if he reaches extreme old age, or is 
    in a serious accident, and other matters that may happen by the divine 
    decree.
    Thirdly: 
In 
    the answer to question no. 184737 we mentioned the 
    signs which are indicative of a person being righteous at the time of his 
    death, and the signs which are indicative of a bad end.
    Fourthly: 
If 
    a person feels that his death is approaching because of severe illness and 
    the like, then what he must do is hasten to set things straight by repenting 
    to Allah, making up for any wrongs done to people and asking them for 
    forgiveness, hastening to do righteous deeds, being serious and focused in 
    turning to Allah and obeying Him, and seeking pardon and forgiveness from 
    Him by His grace, in addition to thinking positively of Allah, may He be 
    glorified, and trusting in His abundant grace and mercy, and believing that 
    He will never let down a slave who thinks positively of Him.
    Muslim (2877) narrated that Jaabir said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and 
    peace of Allah be upon him) say, three days before he died: “No one of you 
    should die except thinking positively of Allah.” 
He 
    should also do a great deal of those deeds that expiate and erase sins, such 
    as praying for forgiveness, maintaining wudoo’, praying, Hajj and ‘Umrah, 
    and so on.
    Fifthly:
    The agonies of death are the last hardship that a person encounters before 
    meeting Allah, and they are the last thing by means of which Allah expiates 
    the sins of His slave. We ask Allah to make these agonies easy for us and 
    help us to bear them.
    Al-Bukhaari (4449) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that during the sickness of which 
    he died, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    began to put his hand in water and wipe his face with it, saying: “Laa 
    ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), verily death has agonies.” 
    Then he held up his hand and started saying: “With the higher companions…” 
    until he passed away and his hand fell.
    At-Tirmidhi (978) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that she said: I saw the Messenger 
    of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as he was dying. There 
    was a vessel of water next to him, and he would put his hand in the vessel 
    then wipe his face with the water, then he said: “O Allah, help me to bear 
    the agonies of death.”
    Classed as hasan by al-Haafiz in al-Fath (11/362); classed as da‘eef 
    by al-Albaani in Da‘eef at-Tirmidhi

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Do 
    the agonies of death reduced the burden of sin? Does sickness that precedes 
    death do likewise? 
He 
    replied:
    Everything that befalls a person of sickness, hardship, worry, or distress, 
    even a thorn that pricks him, is expiation for his sins. Then if he is 
    patient and seeks reward, in addition to expiation of sin he will have the 
    reward for that patience with which he faced the calamity that befell him. 
    There is no differentiation in that regard between what happens at the time 
    of death and what happens before that.

    End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (24/2)
    Alongside the hardship and agonies of death, what the believer receives of 
    glad tidings and being made steadfast at the time of his death are among the 
    things that will make what he is faced with easier to bear and will make him 
    long for what comes after it of meeting Allah.
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    The dying person can only be one of two things: either it is a relief for 
    him or others are relieved of him. In either case things may be very hard 
    for him at the time of death or they may be alleviated for him. In the 
    former case, he is the one who is faced with the agonies of death, and that 
    has nothing to do with whether he was pious or an evildoer; rather if he was 
    one of the pious it will increase him in reward, otherwise it will expiate 
    for him accordingly, then he will be relieved of the annoyances of this 
    world, of which this is the last. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: I would not 
    like the agonies of death to be reduced for me, for that is the last thing 
    by means of which sin may be expiated for the believer. Yet at the same 
    time, what the believer receives of glad tidings and the angels being happy 
    to meet him, and their accompanying him, and his joy at meeting his Lord, 
    make it easier for him to bear whatever he may face of the pain of death, 
    until it becomes as if he does not feel anything of that.

    End quote from Fath al-Baari (11/365)
    See also the answer to question no. 135314 
We 
    do not know of any way of reducing the agonies of death, except that the 
    individual should turn to his Lord concerning that, and call upon Him at 
    times of hardship and of ease. Perhaps we will do what the Prophet 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did, when he put his hands in the 
    water then wiped his face with them and asked Allah to help him to face the 
    agonies of death, as mentioned above.
    However some of the early generations used to regard this hardship as a 
    mercy, as quoted above from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez. ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad 
    narrated in Zawaa’id az-Zuhd (p. 388) that Ibraaheem an-Nakha‘i said: 
    They used to regard it as mustahabb for the sick person to go through some 
    hardship at the time of death. And it was narrated from Mansoor that 
    Ibraaheem used to like the severe agony of death. 
We 
    do not know of anyone who is saved from this hardship apart from the martyr. 
    Imam Ahmad (7953), at-Tirmidhi (1668 – and he classed it as saheeh), an-Nasaa’i 
    (3161) and Ibn Maajah (2802) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger 
    of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyr does 
    not feel anything more when he is killed than one of you feels if he is 
    pinched.”

    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi and elsewhere.
    Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
    What this means is that Allah, may He be exalted, makes death easy for him 
    and suffices him against its agonies and distress; in fact the martyr may 
    enjoy giving himself for the sake of Allah willingly, as Khubayb al-Ansaari 
    said (in verse):
I 
    do not care if I am killed as a Muslim; it does not matter how I may be 
    killed.

    End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer (4/182)
    Sixthly:
    Righteous deeds are all deeds enjoined, encouraged and recommended by the 
    Lawgiver, and some of them are superior to others. Among the best of 
    righteous deeds by means of which a person may draw close to his Lord and 
    which the Muslim is advised to do constantly are: to remember Allah a great 
    deal,  read Qur’an, honour one’s parents, uphold ties of kinship, perform 
    Hajj and ‘Umrah, offer voluntary prayers at night, give charity in secret, 
    have a good attitude, spread the greeting of salaam, feed people, speak 
    truthfully, enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, love good for 
    people, refrain from harming them, co-operate in righteousness and piety, 
    reconcile between people and other righteous deeds.

    26242 
We 
    advise the questioner to take thinking of death and its hardships as a means 
    of encouraging her to fear Allah and do righteous deeds, for if a person 
    fears Allah and does good, Allah will make all difficulties easy for him, 
    and relieve him of every distress and hardship.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/101/where-zakaah-is-to-be-spent,"What is the ruling on using Zakaah funds to support a Qur’aan contest in a local school, because the school does not support these activities? What is the ruling on using zakaah funds to renovate the musalla (prayer room) in the school?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    Allaah has spoken about 
    zakaah funds in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“As-Sadaqaat (here it 
    means Zakaah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen (the poor) 
    and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of 
    those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and 
    for those in debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those 
    fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off 
    from everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, 
    All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:60]
The majority of scholars 
    are of the view that what is meant by the phrase “and for Allaah’s Cause” 
    is jihad for the sake of Allaah. 
See the answers to 
    questions no. 21805 and
    6977. 
Based on that, it is not 
    permissible to build schools or mosques or musallas (prayer rooms) with 
    zakaah funds. 
The same applies to Qur’aan 
    competitions; zakaah funds should not be spent on them. There are many ways 
    of doing good that can help these projects, such as giving voluntary charity 
    (sadaqah), establishing waqfs and giving gifts. 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may 
    Allaah preserve him) was asked: We have a group which is undertaking a major 
    project, which is to build a jaami’ mosque and an Arabic Islamic school in 
    which there is a section just for memorizing the Holy Qur’aan, and a medical 
    clinic. Is it permissible for this organization to accept zakaah funds for 
    this project? 
He replied: The basic 
    principle is that zakaah may only be given to the eight categories mentioned 
    in the Qur’aan, which are: the poor, the needy, those who work to collect 
    zakaah, to attract those whose hearts inclined towards Islam, slaves who 
    have a contract of manumission, debtors, mujaahideen and wayfarers. Some 
    scholars are of the view that charitable projects come under the heading of 
    “for the cause of Allaah”, but the preferred view is that this refers to 
    jihad only. 
Based on this, you should 
    look for funds other than zakaah for this project. And Allaah knows best. 
    Fataawa al-Shaykh ibn Jibreen. 
It says in Fataawa 
    al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (9/447): With regard to Qur’aan schools, if the 
    zakaah-giver gives it to one of the people in charge of this school for him 
    to give it to poor students and others, that is permissible, even if it is 
    transferred to them from one country to another, if transferring it will 
    serve some interest. But if the zakaah-giver spends it on the school’s 
    budget so that it will be spent on teaching Qur’aan and religious knowledge, 
    that is not permissible. End quote.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to spend zakaah on 
    building mosques and schools and on places for teaching the Holy Qur’aan? 
He replied: This is a 
    matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion, which 
    stems from different interpretations of the aayah in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “and for Allaah’s Cause” – is what 
    is meant everything by means of which a person may draw closer to Allaah of 
    righteous deeds which serve the public interest, or does it mean fighting 
    for the sake of Allaah only? It seems to me that what is meant is fighting 
    for the sake of Allaah only, because this is what is known when the phrase 
    is used in general terms, and because if we assume that it is general in 
    meaning, then there would be no point in the restriction reflected in the 
    words “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for…”. And because 
    restricting it to fighting is more on the safe side, and whatever is more on 
    the safe side is more appropriate to be followed. 
With regard to what the 
    questioner referred to of building schools and so on, these are good deeds 
    which people are encouraged to do. They may be spent on from other 
    charitable sources.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/269/islamic-politics,"The global human rights organizations call for justice and equality and speak against oppression and transgression against people on the grounds of gender, race and colour, and support other noble principles. Is there any reason why we should not cooperate with them? If there is, what is the basis of objecting to these noble principles?.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    The Muslim should not be 
    deceived by the so called western and European “human rights” organizations, 
    because although they outwardly appear to support the oppressed and to take 
    a stance against torture and undermining of human dignity in prisons and 
    detention centres – which in general terms are good ideas – they also play 
    other roles, and support other principles which are aimed at destroying the 
    family, and opening the door to slander against Islam and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and all his fellow-Prophets. 
    They are opposed to the rule of sharee’ah which enjoins hadd punishments 
    such as stoning for the adulterer, execution for the apostate and cutting 
    off the hand for the thief, becoming part of legislation and being 
    implemented, which is in fact very rare. These organizations are also 
    opposed to the shar’i rulings that have to do with women, such as the 
    necessity of her wali’s consent for marriage, the command to observe hijab, 
    and the prohibition on her mixing, in addition to other principles where 
    they claim that they want to liberate man from religious obligations and to 
    make man free in the way he conducts his affairs, not restricted by good 
    morals or sublime shar’i rulings.  
To sum up what these 
    organizations promote: it is that man should be able to do whatever he 
    wants, no matter how perverse. They support lesbians, homosexuals and 
    bisexuals, and religious deviance. They regard it as a human right to 
    disbelieve in whatever religions one wants and to express one’s opinion – 
    even about the Prophets – without any fear or shame, and they also support 
    the liberation of woman from the control of her father, husband or religion. 
Secondly: 
There follow some of the 
    articles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which was approved by 
    the United Nations on 10/12/1948 CE, which we are quoting from their 
    website: 
Article 2.
Everyone is entitled to all 
    the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction 
    of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or 
    other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 
Article 18.
Everyone has the right to 
    freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to 
    change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community 
    with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in 
    teaching, practice, worship and observance. 
Article 19.
Everyone has the right to 
    freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold 
    opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information 
    and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. 
These so called rights and 
    freedoms which they call for all people to enjoy regardless of religion make 
    the monotheist and the polytheist equally entitled to these rights and 
    freedoms, so the slave of Allaah and the slave of the Shaytaan are placed on 
    the same level, and every worshipper of rocks, idols or people is given the 
    complete right and freedom to enjoy his kufr and heresy. This is contrary to 
    the laws of Allaah in this world and the Hereafter. 
Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“Shall We then treat the 
    Muslims (believers of Islamic Monotheism, doers of righteous deeds) like the 
    Mujrimoon (criminals, polytheists and disbelievers)?
36. What is the matter 
    with you? How judge you?”
[al-Qalam 68:35, 36] 
“Shall We treat those 
    who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah  
    Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsidoon (those who 
    associate partners in worship with Allaah and commit crimes) on earth? Or 
    shall We treat the Muttaqoon (the pious) as the Fujjaar (criminals, 
    disbelievers, the wicked)?”
[Saad 38:28] 
“Is then he who is a 
    believer like him who is a Faasiq (disbeliever and disobedient to Allaah)? 
    Not equal are they”
[al-Sajdah 32:18].
It is a call to abolish the 
    ruling on apostasy, and to openly flaunt the principles of kufr and heresy. 
    It is a call to open the door to everyone who wants to criticize Islam or 
    the Prophet of Islam Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) and to have the freedom to criticize and express oneself with no 
    restrictions. 
These are corrupt 
    principles. Even if they suit their lives, values and religion, they do not 
    suit us and they are contrary to our pure sharee’ah, which brought rulings 
    that are suited to individuals and societies, and establish noble morals, 
    and protect minds, honour, physical well being and wealth, and show people 
    the religion which Allaah loves and is pleased with. 
Article 3.
Everyone has the right to 
    life, liberty and security of person. 
It is from this Article 
    that the calls of these organizations come to protect criminals against 
    execution, and started to give bad publicity to the nations which carry out 
    the hadd punishments of Allaah by stoning married adulterers and executing 
    bandits and those who spread mischief in the land. Now these organizations 
    proudly claim that they have convinced many nations to abolish the death 
    penalty for killers, rapists and criminals. This is contrary to sound human 
    nature, reason and sharee’ah, and it is a message that gives peace of mind 
    to those criminals that their lives will never be lost because of their 
    deeds, which is a way of spreading mischief on earth. 
They claim that the 
    individual has the right to life and liberty, even if it is a bestial life, 
    and even if that freedom leads to corruption, sicknesses and loss of 
    security for the family and society. 
Article 16.
Men and women of full age, 
    without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right 
    to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to 
    marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. 
This article annuls the 
    role of the woman’s guardian (wali) which is to protect the woman’s rights 
    in marriage, and to help his daughter or sister to make a good choice, and 
    to ask about the religious commitment and character of the suitor. It is by 
    His wisdom that Allaah has prescribed this. If marriage was left up to the 
    woman without her guardian’s consent, you would see most girls marrying 
    those who enchant them of the wolves of men, who are eager to rob them of 
    their chastity then throw them aside.  
They also give the wife the 
    same rights of divorce as the husband has. This is something that causes 
    women to turn against their husbands and leads to the break up of their 
    families. The one who knows the nature of men and women will not be able to 
    agree to such nonsense. Western families are not so intact that we can say: 
    Look at how they were destroyed. The call for homosexual rights and the 
    rights of women to form any relationship she wants and women’s rights in 
    marriage and divorce – what families can be built on such shaky foundations?  
It is worth noting that 
    these organizations are used for political purposes to put pressure on the 
    Muslim states that care about virtue, modesty and morals, or that apply all 
    or some of the rulings of sharee’ah. Some Muslim nations have abolished the 
    death penalty, and they have introduced strict laws about marriage at an 
    early age for both genders, but they pay attention to woman’s rights to 
    khula’ and maintenance, etc, which causes widespread mischief and evil in 
    many areas of life."

If the situation is as you describe then you did something bad and committed a great sin. You have to repent and seek forgiveness, and you have to try hard to look for the owner of the money. If you find him, then ask his pardon and give him the money. If you cannot find him then look for his heir and give him the money. If you cannot find his heir, then give the money in charity with the intention that the reward should go to the owner. If you find the owner or his heir after that, then tell him what happened; if he approves, all well and good, otherwise give him what is his due, then you will have the reward for the money given in charity.

    divorce as an oath. 
    Your aunt should understand that it is not essential that she

    her divorce being conditional upon her entering her sister’s house shows 
    that he did not intend to stop her, rather he intended that the divorce 
    should take place. If he had wanted to stop her, he would have made sure she 
    heard what he said or he would have told her afterwards.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/186/womens-clothing,World Hijab Day is celebrated on 1 February every year. What do the scholars say about that? What is your view concerning this issue? Is this regarded as coming under the heading of innovation (bid ‘ah)?,"Praise
      be to Allah

	World Hijab Day is an idea promoted by a Muslim woman living 
	in the USA called Nazma Khan. She is a Muslim woman of Bengali origin who 
	migrated to the US when she was eleven years old, and she faced all kinds of 
	harrassment and pressure because of her hijab, which made her think of a way 
	to put a stop to this discrimination against the hijab. The way she came up 
	with was to call women of all countries, religions and races to put on the 
	hijab for at least one day, namely the first day of February, which is known 
	as World Hijab Day.
	Hijab is a well-established obligation that Allah, may He be 
	glorified, has prescribed for believing women. It is a symbol of chastity 
	and a sign of dignity and piety. Muslim scholars, preachers and individuals 
	must do their utmost to call people to it and encourage it, but despite that 
	the methods used to achieve this aim must be methods that are prescribed in 
	Islam, because the means of pursuing praiseworthy goals should be in 
	accordance with Islamic teaching. As for designating a particular day in the 
	year, that is repeated every year and is called World Hijab Day, that is not 
	permissible, for the following reasons:
	Firstly:
	This involves imitating the traditions of the disbelievers 
	who are enemies to Allah, may He be glorified, and are enemies to His 
	Messengers. It is they who introduced such ideas, and allocated for every 
	issue that they want to promote and disseminate an occasion to celebrate it, 
	that is repeated every year, such as the International Day of the Child, the 
	International Day Against Violence Against Women, International Cancer Day, 
	the International Day for People with Special Needs, Mother’s Day, national 
	festivals (such as Independence Day and the like), and many other examples 
	of such innovations and evil practices for which Allah has not sent down any 
	authority.
	Rather these things are more akin to reprehensible 
	innovations, because allocating a particular day that is repeated every 
	year, on which people gather to do certain things makes this day a kind of 
	“eid” or festival, because the root meaning of the word eid refers to 
	something that returns and is repeated.
	The scholars of the Standing Committee said, in Fataawa 
	al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah – vol. 1 (3/88): Eid is a word that refers to 
	something that is repeated, of gatherings in a customary manner, either once 
	a year, once a month, or once a week, and the like. So the word eid refers 
	to several things, such as a special day that is repeated, such as the day 
	of Eid al-Fitr or the day of Jumu‘ah (Friday); the gatherings held on those 
	days; or the activities that are done on those days, both acts of worship 
	and customs and traditions. End quote.
	See also the answer to question no 10070.
	The prescription of eids or festivals can only come from 
	Allah, may He be glorified, like all other matters of prescription or 
	legislation, that can only come from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, 
	to Whom belong the power of creation and command, legislation and ruling, 
	permitting and forbidding. Allah, may He be glorified, has not prescribed 
	for us Muslims anything but two eids only, namely Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr; 
	then there is the weekly “eid”, which is the day of Jumu‘ah (Friday).
	Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

	All eids or festivals other than the prescribed eids are 
	innovated festivals that have been introduced into the religion. They were 
	not known at the time of the righteous early generations, and they may have 
	originated among non-Muslims. Therefore they involve the innovation of 
	imitating the enemies of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The 
	prescribed eids are well known to the Muslims; they are Eid al-Fitr and Eid 
	al-Adha, as well as the weekly eid (the day of Jumu‘ah). There are no other 
	eids in Islam apart from these three.

	End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (2/301)
	Secondly:
	The celebrations that happen on this day involve 
	entertainment, exuberance and foolishness that are contrary to the purpose 
	behind the prescription of the hijab, and indeed all other prescribed 
	rulings. That is because when it comes to the rulings prescribed by Allah, 
	may He be glorified, people should hasten to do them and adhere to them in a 
	spirit of humility, submission, seeking reward from Allah and aiming thereby 
	to draw close to Allah, may He be glorified, hoping for His reward and 
	fearing His wrath and punishment. As for women gathering on the so-called 
	World Hijab Day, in an atmosphere of fun, playing, celebrating and 
	exuberance, inviting women of all religions, nationalities and races to put 
	on the hijab for a single day so they can take pictures and publish these 
	pictures as a kind of advertisement, then take off the hijab after that – 
	all of that is a kind of toying with the commands of Allah, because hijab is 
	an act of worship in which it is essential to have the correct intention, 
	seeking reward with Allah and persisting in it.
	Thirdly:
	The kind of hijab that women wear on this day often makes a 
	mockery of this divinely-ordained obligation, and does more harm than good. 
	That is because with regard to hijab as prescribed in Islam, there are 
	conditions and criteria which, if they are met, then it is the correct 
	Islamic hijab that Allah has enjoined upon women. But if these conditions 
	are not met – in full or in part – then this cannot be called correct 
	Islamic hijab. These criteria have been discussed previously in fatwa no.
	6991. As for the hijab that women wear on this 
	occasion, in most cases it has nothing to do with correct Islamic hijab; in 
	fact all that the woman does in this case is cover her hair and body, but at 
	the same time she may be wearing pants, or the clothes may be tight and show 
	the shape of the body, or she may be wearing make-up, or the clothes that 
	she is wearing may be an adornment in and of themselves, as they are 
	colourful, adorned and attract attention or provoke desire in sick hearts. 
	All of these things are contrary to the hijab that Allah has enjoined.
	Based on that, celebrating so-called World Hijab Day is not 
	permissible, even if the intention of the people behind it is good and 
	sincere. However sincere intention alone is not sufficient; rather it is 
	essential that the methods used should be in accordance with Islamic 
	teachings, and not involve anything that is contrary to the command of 
	Allah, may He be glorified.

	However, if a group of Muslims, men or women, gather in a 
	certain place at a certain time in order to promote the obligation of hijab 
	and inform people about it, then this is a good thing and comes under the 
	promotion of what is right and good, that Allah, may He be glorified, has 
	enjoined upon us. But when doing that, it is essential to adhere to the 
	following guidelines:
	·
	they should not imitate the disbelievers and their 
	customary practices in celebrating such things

	·
	they should not allocate a specific day that is repeated 
	every year, because this is a kind of innovation, as explained above

	·
	they should call women to adhere to correct Islamic hijab, 
	fulfilling all the criteria and conditions that have been explained by the 
	scholars, as discussed in the fatwa referred to above

	·
	they should inform women that hijab is a well-established 
	obligation and an important act of worship, in which believing women worship 
	Allah, so they should hasten to do it and persist in it. As for calling 
	women to put on hijab for one or two days, and the like, that is not 
	permissible.

	And Allah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/218/supplication,"One of the basic principles of Islam is that a human in the eyes of Allah is always equal. When we pray, at the end of our prayer, after the Tashahhud, we always ask Allah to bestow peace and blessings on the Prophet, and his family. We do not say peace upon the rest of the ummah or the sahabah etc. With regard to this, please can you explain to me fully what is the status of the prophets family.","Praise
      be to Allah

	Firstly:

	Submission to Allah and His Messenger is one of the 
	fundamentals of the Islamic religion, without which it cannot be complete. 
	Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):

	“But no, by your Lord, they can 
	have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah 
	be upon him)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no 
	resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission”

	[an-Nisa’ 4:65].

	Submission leaves no room for doubt and it puts an end to the 
	whispers of the Shaytaan. By means of submission one may attain certainty 
	and perfect faith, and when there is submission, one does not need to ask 
	why or how.

	Secondly:

	People are all equal in terms of them being slaves of Allah, 
	but after that they very in status and virtue according to their level of 
	piety or fear of Allah, as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says 
	(interpretation of the meaning):

	“O mankind! We have created you 
	from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may 
	know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allâh is that 
	(believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (pious)]”

	[al-Hujuraat 49:13].

	The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) said on the middle day of the days of at-Tashreeq: “O people, verily 
	your Lord is one and your father is one. Verily there is no superiority of 
	an Arab over a non-Arab or of a non-Arab over an Arab, or of a red man over 
	a black man, or of a black man over a red man, except in terms of piety. 
	Have I conveyed the message?” They said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him) has conveyed the message.

	Narrated by Ahmad (22978) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
	in as-Saheehah (2700).

	Thirdly:

	Sending greetings of salaam upon the Prophet (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him) and upon the righteous slaves of Allah in the 
	prayer is done in the tashahhud, which is then followed by sending blessings 
	upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and upon his 
	family.

	The greeting of salaam is sent upon all the righteous slaves 
	of Allah in heaven and on earth, as al-Bukhaari (831) and Muslim (402) 
	narrated that Ibn Mas‘ood said: When we prayed behind the Messenger of Allah 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), we used to say: Peace (salaam) 
	be upon Allah, peace be upon So and so. The Messenger of Allah (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us one day: “Allah is as-Salaam, so 
	when one of you sits to pray, let him say: 
	at-Tahiyyaatu Lillaahi wa’s-salawaatu wa’t-tayyibaat; as-salaamu ‘alayka 
	ayyuha’n-nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakaatuhu; as-salaamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala 
	‘ibaad-illaah is-saaliheen (All compliments, prayers and good words are 
	due to Allah; peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His 
	blessings; peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah). For if 
	you say that it will reach every righteous slave in the heavens and on 
	earth. (Then say:) Ash-hadu al-laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa ash-hadu anna 
	Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasooluhu (I bear witness that there is no god 
	except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).”

	As for sending blessings when saying “Allahumma salli ‘ala 
	Muhammad… wa baarik ‘ala Muhammad” what is prescribed is for it to be 
	intended for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his 
	family, and it is said after the Tashahhud.

	This is how it is prescribed and it is prescribed to be 
	exclusively for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and 
	his family. Allah instructed His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
	upon him) to say it this way, and He has commanded people to follow the 
	Prophet’s example and act in accordance with his Sunnah, as the Prophet 
	(blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us when he said: “Pray as 
	you have seen me praying.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (631).

	Allah, may He be exalted, bestows His favour and generosity 
	upon whomever He will among His slaves. He is not to be questioned about 
	what He does and no objection is to be raised to what He prescribes on the 
	basis of what people may think or imagine. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
	(interpretation of the meaning):

	“He selects for His Mercy (Islam 
	and the Qur’an with Prophethood) whom He wills and Allah is the Owner of 
	Great Bounty”

	[Aal ‘Imraan 3:74]

	“That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He 
	wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower”

	[al-Maa’idah 5:54].

	It is well-known that the family of the Prophet (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoy special virtue and status that others 
	do not share.

	Moreover, the grace of Allah will be bestowed upon the 
	righteous and His slaves with the sending of greetings of salaam upon them, 
	as we see above. Obviously, it is not necessarily the case that those who 
	are favoured receive equal favour in all things.

	Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught 
	his Companions to send blessings upon him when they said to him: O Messenger 
	of Allah, we know how to send greetings of salaam upon you, but how should 
	we send blessings upon you? He said: “Say: 
	Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammadin kama salayta ‘ala 
	aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun majeed; Allahumma baarik ‘ala Muhammadin wa 
	‘ala aali Muhammadin kama baarakta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun 
	majeed (O Allah, send Your salaah (grace, honour and mercy) upon 
	Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your salaah 
	upon the family of Ibraaheem, You are indeed Praiseworthy, Most Glorious. O 
	Allah, send Your blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You 
	sent Your blessings upon the family of Ibraaheem, You are indeed 
	Praiseworthy, Most Glorious).”
Narrated by 
	al-Bukhaari (6357) and Muslim (406).
This is how 
	to send blessings upon him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and 
	not one of them said: O Messenger of Allah, why do we send blessings upon 
	you and upon your family, and we do not send blessings upon the Prophets and 
	Messengers of Allah, or upon any of your Companions or any of your ummah? 
	They only said, as Allah tells us about them and about His believing slaves: 
	We hear and we obey. This is what is required of us.
Fourthly:
What is meant 
	by the family of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is 
	his wives and descendants, and Banu Haashim and Banu’l-Muttalib.

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/177/adulteryfornication-and-homosexuality,I would like to know: what is the procedure in the case of a woman who accuses her husband of adultery. Does she take the oath of li-an (curse) upon herself as in surat an-Nur or is this only in the case of a husband who accuses his wife? I searched for the answer here but did not find it anywhere.,"Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    Li’aan is prescribed for 
    two reasons: 
1 – If the husband accuses 
    his wife of zina and cannot produce four witnesses, then he may get the hadd 
    punishment for slander waived by engaging in li’aan. 
2 – If he wants to deny 
    that a child is his. 
The basic principle 
    concerning that is the passage in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And for those who 
    accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the 
    testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e. testifies four times) by 
    Allaah that he is one of those who speak the truth.
7. And the fifth 
    (testimony should be) the invoking of the Curse of Allaah on him if he be of 
    those who tell a lie (against her).
8. But it shall avert 
    the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, if she bears witness four 
    times by Allaah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie.
9. And the fifth 
    (testimony) should be that the Wrath of Allaah be upon her if he (her 
    husband) speaks the truth”
[al-Noor 24:6-9]
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: 
This verse offers a way out 
    to husbands if a husband accuses his wife of zina but it is too difficult 
    for him to establish proof; he may engage in li’aan against her as enjoined 
    by Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. This means bringing her before 
    the judge and making his accusation against her, and the judge should make 
    him swear four times by Allaah, instead of bringing four witnesses, that he 
    is telling the truth i.e., about what he is accusing her of, namely zina. 
    And the fifth time he should invoke the curse of Allaah upon himself if he 
    is lying. If he says this, she becomes irrevocably divorced by virtue of 
    this li’aan, according to al-Shaafa’i and many of the scholars, and she 
    becomes permanently forbidden to him, and he should give her the mahr 
    (dowry), and the hadd punishment for zina should be carried out on her. The 
    punishment is not averted from her unless she also engages in li’aan and 
    swears by Allaah four times that he is lying, i.e., with regard to what he 
    has accused her of; and the fifth time she should invoke the wrath of Allaah 
    upon herself if he is telling the truth. Hence Allaah says 
    “But it shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from 
    her, if she bears witness four times by Allaah, that he (her husband) is 
    telling a lie.
9. And the fifth 
    (testimony) should be that the Wrath of Allaah be upon her if he (her 
    husband) speaks the truth.” End quote. 
As for the wife, if she 
    accuses her husband of zina, but she cannot produce four witnesses, then she 
    should be given the hadd punishment for slander, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
    those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them 
    with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the 
    Faasiqoon (liars, rebellious, disobedient to Allaah)”
[al-Noor 24:4]  
    
These verses apply equally 
    to slander against both women and men. 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: Allaah mentioned women in the verse 
    because they are of greater concern and accusing them of immorality is more 
    abhorrent and more hurtful, but slandering men is also included in the 
    meaning of the verse, and the ummah is unanimously agreed on that. End 
    quote. 
Al-Maawardi said in 
    Ahkaam al-Sultaaniyyah (p. 287): If a woman slanders her husband, she 
    should be given the hadd punishment, but she should not engage in li’aan. 
    End quote. 
If a woman knows that her 
    husband has committed zina but she has no proof, namely four witnesses, then 
    she should advise him and remind him, and tell him to fear Allaah. If he 
    persists in his sin she may ask for a divorce  from him or separate from him 
    by means of khula’, because there is nothing good for her in staying with 
    him, and because his having intercourse with her may be harmful for her. 
And Allaah knows best."
https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/3/basic-tenets-of-faith,Is it obligatory to obey a ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him)?.,"Praise be to Allaah.
The ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger should be obeyed in matters that do not involve disobedience towards Allaah and His Messenger, and it is not obligatory to fight him because of that; rather it is not permissible to do so unless he reaches the level of kufr, in which case it becomes obligatory to oppose him and he has no right to be obeyed by the Muslims. 
Ruling according to anything other than that which is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches the level of kufr when two conditions are met:
1.When he knows the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; if he is unaware of it, then he does not commit kufr by going against it.
2.When what makes him rule by something other than that which Allaah has revealed is the belief that it is a ruling that is not suitable for our time and that something else is more suitable than it and more beneficial for people.
If these two conditions are met, then ruling by something other than that which Allaah has revealed constitutes kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. The authority of the ruler becomes invalid and he has no right to be obeyed by the people; it becomes obligatory to fight him and remove him from power. 
But if he rules by something other than that which Allaah has revealed whilst believing that ruling by that – i.e. that which Allaah has revealed -- is what is obligatory, and that it is more suitable for the people, but he goes against it because of some whims and desires on his part or because he wants to wrong the people under his rule, then he is not a kaafir; rather he is a faasiq (evildoer) or a zaalim (wrongdoer). His authority remains, and obeying him in matters that do not involve disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger is obligatory, and it is not permissible to fight him or remove him from power by force or to rebel against him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) forbade rebelling against rulers unless we see blatant kufr for which we have proof from Allaah.

My question: in this company there is a section for food, i.e., a restaurant in which they sell pork and alcohol, but my husband works in the section that sells clocks and gold. Is his salary considered halaal or haraam? I hope that you can explain in detail.","Praise be to Allaah. 
       
    Firstly: 
In many 
    answers on this site we have warned against settling in kaafir countries, 
    because that has a clear negative impact on a man’s religious commitment. He 
    is exposed to temptations and specious arguments which may cause him to be 
    tempted away from his religion. We ask Allaah to keep us all safe and sound. 
    Seeing evil actions and not being able to denounce them or change them 
    usually leads to a person not regarding them as abhorrent in his heart. 
Hence it is 
    not permissible for a Muslim to settle in a kaafir country if he fears for 
    his religious commitment. 
See 
    questions no. 38284 and 
    13363 
Secondly: 
If your 
    husband’s work in the section that sells clocks and gold has no connection 
    to the restaurant and the haraam things that are sold there, then his salary 
    is halaal, because it is given in return for permissible work, and he has no 
    share of the sin of the company for the haraam things that it sells. 
The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions dealt 
    with the Jews in permissible transactions, even though the Jews used to 
    engage in other transactions that were haraam, such as riba (usury), bribes 
    and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. Al-Tabaraani narrated that Ka’b 
    ibn ‘Ujrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and I saw him changed in 
    appearance. I said: “May my father be sacrificed for you, why do I see you 
    changed in appearance?” He said: “I have not eaten anything for three days.” 
    I went and I saw a Jew watering a camel of his. I helped him with it and for 
    every bucket of water I drew for him he gave me one date. I gathered some 
    dates and brought them to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb

https://islamqa.info/en/categories/topics/245/bad-behaviour,"to be a true beliver 1 quility is to love for your brother what u love for yourself. Alhamdulillah this is easy to do with my blood brother, but very difficult to do this for any of my muslim brothers except a few , the reason being is that when i see my muslim brother better then me in anything i feel jealous, i thing it's pride(brother i make duaa to allah to forgive me for felling like this but when i see my muslim brother again,this feeling comes back again) 

 I want to fell happy seeing my muslim brother prosper and i want to fell sad when he's sad.but whenever i see people praising my muslim brother i fell jealous. 

 i also fell like wanting for my muslim brother janatul ferdose but whenever my muslim brother tells me something which will benefit me for deen, i want to practice it but saythan comes and tell me that if i practice it then my muslim brother would get the same rewards as i would and so his stage will be higher then minein jannah, my nafs sometimes fall for this trap. i would like to knowhow i can get total cure from this problem.","Praise be to 
          Allaah. 
What every Muslim is obliged to do, as you mentioned, 
          is to love for his brother what he loves for himself of good things, 
          and to hate for his brother what he hates for himself of bad things. 
          This does not mean that he cannot like for himself what he likes for 
          others. If he sees that his brother has something that he does not, 
          and he wishes that he had it too, this is ghibtah (envy that 
          is free from malice); if he wishes that the blessing would be taken 
          away from them, this is called hasad (destructive jealousy).  
          
The Muslim needs to strive against his own self (jihaad 
          al-nafs) so that his heart will be free of jealousy towards his 
          Muslim brothers. If he sincerely loves his brothers, most of these problems 
          from which he is suffering will disappear. When the Muslim realizes 
          how great his virtue and status will be when he loves his brothers and 
          loves good things for them, and when he knows how great his reward will 
          be if he treats them well, this will motivate him to treat them well 
          in all ways, and to strive to benefit his brothers instead of being 
          preoccupied with jealous thoughts of what they have and he doesn’t.  
          
Shaykh Muhammad al-Duwaysh.  
You have to think long and hard about the words of Allaah 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows 
          on whom He wills 
          
[al-Maa’idah 
          5:54]  
“It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood 
          in this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks, so 
          that some may employ others in their work 
          
[al-Zukhruf 43:32]  
Hasad (destructive jealousy) causes a great deal 
          of harm in this world and in the Hereafter. Al-Tirmidhi narrated from 
          al-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awaam that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“There has come to 
          you the disease of the nations before you, jealousy and hatred. This 
          is the ‘shaver’ (destroyer); I do not say that it shaves hair, but that 
          it shaves  (destroys) faith. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, 
          you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe 
          until you love one another. Shall I not tell you of that which will 
          strengthen love between you? Spread (the greeting of) salaam amongst 
          yourselves.” (A hasan hadeeth. Jaami’ al-Tirmidhi, 2434).  
          
Concerning the meaning of the phrase “it shaves (destroys) 
          faith”, al-Tayyibi said: “i.e., hatred takes away faith like a razor 
          takes away hair.” (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi bi Sharh Jaami’ al-Tirmidhi).  
          
It seems, my brother, that you know the ruling and are 
          aware of the consequences, and that you want to rid yourself of this 
          blameworthy characteristic. Here are some solutions for you.  
1-                 
          Make 
          du’aa’ (supplication) to Allaah and ask Him to rid you of this problem. 
          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say in his du’aa’, 
          “Wa’hdi qalbi wa’slul sakheemata sadri (guide my heart and remove 
          ill will from my breast).” The phrase “guide my heart” means to the 
          straight path, and “remove ill will from my breast” means take away 
          all insincerity, rancour and hatred. 
2-                 
          Pondering 
          the meanings of the Qur’aan and reading it frequently, especially the 
          verses which speak of hasad (destructive jealousy), because reading 
          the Qur’aan brings one a great deal of hasanaat (reward for good 
          deeds). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds 
[Hood 11:114] 
3-                 
          Reading 
          the seerah (biography) of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), seeing how he kept away 
          from hasad and how he loved good for others, even for his enemies. Among 
          the useful books on seerah is Noor al-Yaqeen fi Seerat Sayyid al-Mursaleen. 
          
[Translator’s note: a well-known book of seerah which is available 
          in English is “Al-Raheeq al-Makhtoom (the Sealed Nectar) – Biography 
          of the Noble Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by Safi-ur-Rahmaan al-Mubarakpuri]
4-                 
          Reading 
          the biographies and stories of the Sahaabah in books such as Suwar 
          min Hayaat al-Sahaabah by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan Ra’fat al-Basha) 
5-                 
          If any 
          such thoughts (of hasad, etc.) cross your mind, then seek refuge 
          with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, and keep yourself busy with 
          something that will make you forget these insinuating whispers and thoughts. 
          
6-                 
          If the 
          Shaytaan manages to instil hasad in your heart, then beware lest 
          you say or do anything which will show that hasad. Every person 
          has his or her share of hasad. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
          “Nobody is free from hasad, but the noble person hides it whilst 
          the base person shows it.” (Amraad al-Quloob). A person will 
          not be brought to account for whatever crosses his mind, but he will 
          be brought to account for what he says and does. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will forgive 
          my ummah for their mistakes, what they forget and what they are 
          forced to do.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari,  2033). 
          
7-                 
          If you 
          feel that you are jealous of a specific person, then buy him a gift 
          and shake hands with him. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Shake hands, for 
          this will dispel rancour, and exchange gifts and love one another, for 
          this will dispel hatred.” (Narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta’, 
          1413). Hasad is the result of hatred, whose opposite is love, 
          the way of which is giving gifts and spreading (the greeting of) salaam, 
          because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You will not enter 
          Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love 
          one another. Shall I not tell you of that which will strengthen love 
          between you? Spread (the greeting of) salaam amongst yourselves.” (Narrated 
          by Muslim, 81).  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Amraad 
          al-Quloob (diseases of the heart):  
“Whoever find in himself any hasad towards another 
          has to try to neutralize it by means of taqwa (piety, consciousness 
          of Allaah) and sabr (patience). So he should hate that (the feeling 
          of hasad) in himself… But the one who does wrong to his brother 
          by word or deed will be punished for that. The one who fears Allaah 
          and is patient, however, is not included among the wrongdoers, and Allaah 
          will benefit him by his taqwa.” 
And Allaah knows best."
