Is the Umra valid?,"The reply is in different forms: 
 N* 1- The pilgrim knows that Safa &amp; Marwa mounts do not continue up to the new Masa'a (place for Sai'ee). In this case, to be able to come out from the state of Ihram, the pilgrim should slaughter an animal (Kurbani) in Mecca -in terms of obligatory precaution, that animal should have the same conditions as the sacrifice in Mina- and distribute it among the poor and then cut his hair (Takseer) or shave his head (Halq). This applies to the one who was not aware of this current situation before being clothed in Ihram. Otherwise, if he had known this problem beforehand, according to obligatory precaution, he cannot come out from Ihram and should stay there until the accomplishment of the Sai'ee become possible for him. He may refer in this case to another Marja considering the most knowledgeable (Aalam fal Aalam) 
 N* 2- The pilgrim is sure that the mounts continue up to the new   
Masa'a or this is proven by the Fatwa of some other Maraje that   
trustees had witnessed and this witness is not contradicting the view of other trustees. In such case, it is allowed to do the Sai'ee in the new place. 
   N* 3- If none of the above situations are proven for him, he should do both: Sai'ee in the new way and also slaughtering an animal with the same conditions mentioned above, and then do Halq or Taqseer. 
 Note: 
 For those who have already done their Umra with the Sai'ee in the new way should now sacrifice the animal and then do Halq or Taqseer, even if they have already come back to their countries, as they are still considered as Muhrim (being in the state of Ihram)."

But if he was ignorant out of negligence in learning the Islamic laws or did mistakes which do invalidate the act in general (e.g., leaving out some parts of the body which must be washed in wudhu or ghusl), there is no way to validate his past prayers and pilgrimage. 
However, if there is the fear that he would totally rebel when asked to make up all the past prayers and pilgrimage, then it is not appropriate to ask him to do so. Maybe Allah will improve his situation in future."

For every day, however, she should give one mudd (750 grams) of food to poor. In both the cases, she has to give qadha for the fasts which are left out. 
Also, if a woman who is not in an advanced stage of pregnancy but fasting is harmful or unbearably difficult, fasting is not wajib on her. She must keep the qadha later and there is no kaffara on her. 
In both case, if a woman fails to observe the Qadha of the missed fast until next Ramadhan, she must, as an obligatory precaution, give another kaffara because of delaying the Qadha."

http://www.sistani.org/english/qa/01226/,Why should we do Istibra and how is it done?,"Istibra is a recommended act for men after urinating. Its object is to ensure that no more urine is left in the urethra.

Thereafter, the part between the anus and the root of penis should be pressed thrice, with the mid dle finger of the left hand. Then the thumb is placed on the penis, and the forefinger below it pressing three times up to the point of circumcision, then the front part of the penis should be jerked three times."

http://www.sistani.org/english/qa/01350/,"A person used to make mistakes in the way he performed his wudhu (minor ablution) or ghusl (major ablution). After many years, he comes to realize his mistakes. When he inquires as how to solve his problem, he is told: ""Repeat all your prayers and perform the pilgrimage again."" Since saying all the prayers and doing the pilgrimage again is difficult, is there a solution which would salvage his prayers and pilgrimage performed with wudhu and ghusl that he thought was correct? Is there such a solution as a concession to this person so that he does not become disheartened and rebellions against religious obligations in a society which encourages such kind of rebellion?","If he was ignorant out of innocence, and therefore made mistakes without causing harm (e.g., did not follow the proper sequence in washing the head and the other parts of the body in ghusl; or did the wiping of the head or feet [mash] with a new water), then his wudhu and ghusl will be considered correct; and, consequently, his past prayers and pilgrimage will also be considered correct. 
But if he was ignorant out of negligence in learning the Islamic laws or did mistakes which do invalidate the act in general (e.g., leaving out some parts of the body which must be washed in wudhu or ghusl), there is no way to validate his past prayers and pilgrimage. 
However, if there is the fear that he would totally rebel when asked to make up all the past prayers and pilgrimage, then it is not appropriate to ask him to do so. Maybe Allah will improve his situation in future."

But she can leave her face and hands upto wrists uncovered in the presence of Na-Mahram, as long as it does not lead him to casting a sinful, evil glance or her to doing something forbidden; for in both these cases, she must cover them."

http://www.sistani.org/english/qa/01135/,"What is the proper definition of 'backbiting'? Please, give some references from the Quran and Hadith also.","Backbiting means “speaking ill of a believer in their absence of someone with the purpose of disparaging him, no matter whether the alleged shortcoming was related to his body, lineage, behaviour, deeds, statements, religion, or life, and other defects which are [usually] concealed from the people. Similarly, it does not matter whether the description was done by words or by gesture.” 
Almighty Allãh condemned backbiting in His noble Book and has described it such that mind and body feel abhorrence towards it. He said, “And some of you should not backbite the others: would anyone of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? No, you abhor it.” (49:12) 
The Prophet (s.a.w.) said, “Be careful of backbiting because backbiting is worse than adultery, in that a person who commits adultery can repent and ask forgiveness from God, and Allãh can forgive him whereas Allãh will not forgive the backbiter until the person who was at the receiving end forgives him.”"

And is it forbidden for man to wear the necktie, if it is made of natural and pure silk?","It is not forbidden to wear a tie, even if it is from pure silk because it is not [big enough material] to cover the private parts that must be covered [in prayer]. As for the item that is mixed with other material to the extent that it cannot be described as “pure silk,” it is permissible to wear, even if it [is big enough so that it] can cover the private parts that must be covered [in prayer]."

http://www.sistani.org/english/qa/01133/,"What is the Islamic law about buying a car on installments? Many auto companies and authorized car selling agencies sell new and used cars on installments. Thus, when customers go to buy those cars, the companies refer them to certain institutions such as banks and insurance companies. The companies get back the capital as well as the interest in monthly installments stretched over a number of months or years. If someone fails to pay his installments on time, the company overcharges the defaulter.  The interest rate is determined on the basis of certain important factors such as the client's turnover, amount of income or timely-repayment of installments. The amount of interest generally paid is 4%, 3% or 5% or more or less. What is the Islam law with regard to buying a car on monthly installments keeping in view the foregoing details?","If the loan providing companies first buy the cars from the agencies and then sell them to customers on installments with some increase (interest) as part of the prices of the cars, the transaction is in order. Indeed, if a penalty is imposed due to a customer failing to make payment on time, it is forbidden (harām).
