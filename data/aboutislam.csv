Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother, thank you for your question and for your concern to be more knowledgeable about Islam’s teachings.There is nothing wrong with sprinkling water on the grave, but it also has nothing to do with cooling the deceased.As for what benefits the dead, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said, “When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge (which he has left behind), or a righteous child who will pray for him.” (An-Nasai’)In response to your question, Sheikh Ibn `Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy upon him), stated,There is nothing wrong with sprinkling water on the grave after burying a deceased person, because water holds the earth together in order not to scatter right and left.With regard to what the common people believe that sprinkling water cools down the deceased, there is no basis for this.

Wa`alykum as-salaamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:There are two conditions for currency exchange:1- If you change large units for small units of the same currency, the total amount must be the same.2- The exchange must be on the spot.In his response to your question, Prof. Dr. Monzer Kahf, Professor of Islamic Finance and Economics at Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, states:In currency exchange two conditions are necessary:1- If you change large units for small units of the same currency (e.g., 100 dollar bills for one dollar bill) the total amount must be the same; and,2-The exchange must be on the spot, i.e., delivery of the two currencies must be made at the time of the contract.This means:a) Exchange of Euro for Dinar can be done at any price agreeable to the two parties as long as there is no cheating or big deviation from the price that prevails in the market.When governments set prices for transactions that run through central banks, you have to abide by that price only when you have to go through the central bank. Does it mean other prices, such as parallel market price or a black market price, are permissible if you can avoid the central bank? Yes, they are permissible.b) Delivery must be at the time of the contract, you cannot delay any part of the payment of either currency for any time, even a few hours.But when such an exchange is done between countries and if the procedures of the transfers take some time (e.g., a few days), the transaction is still considered as happening on the spot, provided that you do not incorporate any intended delay in the procedure.Hence, you ask for an immediate transfer and immediate charge to your account or you pay cash and any procedural time consumed until the other party receives the other currency in the other country does not violate the principle of immediate delivery.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

What Dawah Activities Can We Do in Summer?								In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Muslims are commanded to set a good example for others in all aspects of life. They have to convey the message of Islam in the best way and not to help distort it.2- It is the responsibility of Muslim individuals, scholars, and people in authority to make dawah and convey the message of Islam to others in the best form and as instructed by the glorious Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).3- They should use wisdom and good admonition and bear into consideration that everyone is free to choose to follow or not to follow the right guidance.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada , states:The Qur’an commands us to call people to the way of Allah. This is explicitly stated in a number of verses; for instance, we read in the Qur’an:“Call [all humankind] unto your Lord’s way with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and dialogue with them in the most gracious manner: For, behold, your Lord knows best as to who strays from His path, and best knows He as to who are the right-guided.” (An-Nahl 16:125)Furthermore, in his farewell sermon, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) addressed Muslims saying, “Let those who are present here convey this message to those who are not present.” (Al-Bukhari)He meant to say that the Muslims have a responsibility to convey the message of Islam to all of humankind. But while doing so, they must always abide by the methodology of the Qur’an. This methodology is based on the assumption that everyone is free to choose to follow or not to follow the right guidance.In other words, the duty of Muslims is limited to conveying the message plainly; they are not supposed to lord over them or push the message down their throats. The Qur’anic principle on this matter is precise and clear: “There shall be no coercion in matters of faith; truth stands out starkly clear from falsehood.” (Al-Baqarah 2:256)Allah further tells His Messenger, “But if they turn away [from you, O Prophet, know that] We have not sent you to be their keeper: You are not bound to do more than deliver the message [entrusted to you.”  (Ash-Shura 42:48)“And so, [O Prophet,] exhort them; your task is only to exhort: You cannot compel them [to believe].” (Al-Ghashiyah 88:21-22)
Once we follow the method described above and keep in mind the sound principles, the activity of dawah is a most rewarding one. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) told his cousin `Ali, “By Allah, if a single person is guided by Allah through you, it will be better for you than a whole lot of red camels.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
So I commend you for your desire to convey the message of mercy inherent in Islam. But while doing so, be forever on guard against self-righteousness, and never fail to arm yourself with compassion and patience.I pray to Allah guide your steps in this noble pursuit, and may He guide us all unto the truth and make us all instruments of guidance.Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

While it may be excused between a mother and a daughter, it is not at all permissible between a mother and her grown-up boys as ruled by scholars.In Islam, we are to avoid things that may inadvertently lead to suspicions or lustful thoughts. One of the rules of jurisprudence states, ‘That which leads to haram is also deemed as haram.’Furthermore, we are to avoid the doubtful.

But storing it with the intention of increasing its price in the market is a different thing.The difference between monopoly and trade is great; in monopoly you just hoard the goods to make prices go up. In trade, you just buy it when it is cheap because it is then abundant and sell it later when it becomes not so abundant in the market. This is in fact a service you make for the consumers.Allah Almighty knows best.  "

Are Black People Going to Hell According to Islam?								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Brother, thanks for your question.First of all, we would like to say that in principle, indulging in the life of this world without neglecting religious duties is definitely permissible. However, a Muslim must be aware that the more he indulges in this life, the more liable he is and the more his responsibilities will increase.This should not make us turn away from succeeding in life and achieving goals, but rather it should make us more attentive to the tricks of Satan. In this regard, Ibrahim Al-Nakh`i, a great scholar who died in 96 AH, was asked: “Is the honest trader preferable to you, or the one who spends all his time in worship?” He said: “The honest trader is preferable to me, because he is in jihad.” Satan comes to him through the weighing and measuring and through his dealing, but he is striving against him.You also mentioned in your question about competing in achieving wealth. In this case, we ought to mention that this kind of competition should never be done for its own sake. However, if it is done for the sake of making Muslims strong and contributing to the achievements of the Muslim Ummah, then it is permissible. Allah the Almighty says in the context of describing the reward of the believers in Paradise, “They are given to drink of a pure wine, sealed, whose seal is musk – for this let (all) those strive who strive for bliss.” (Al-Mutaffifin 83:26) This is the most important type of competitiveness that we should never forget.Moreover, in order to answer your question fully we would like to shed some light on four fundamental beliefs that will surely help us:1- The life of this world is transitory.Imam Al-Ghazali says, “Know that the life of this world is transitory. Its duration is fleeting; it promises eternity but fails in its tryst, you look at it and it seems settled while it is in great motion. It is departing with speed, but the one who looks at it may not feel its movement so he relaxes in it; he will only feel it when it reaches its end. It is like a shadow that moves unperceived; while it is actually moving, it appears to be stationary. You cannot see its movement with the eyes but you can perceive it by inner discernment.” See: Al-Ghazali’s Revitalization of the Sciences of Religion.This is a key belief that each Muslim must adhere to. The more one’s belief in this principle weakens, the more likely his indulgence in the wealth and luxury of this world will hinder him in the Hereafter.2- Wealth is a tool that can be either praiseworthy or blameworthy.Whoever knows the benefit of something and uses it to achieve his aims, has done well and has benefited himself. Wealth is a tool and can be a means to attain a corrupt purpose; and it is that purpose which hinders the person from attaining happiness in the Hereafter and impedes the way to knowledge and achievement. Thus, it is both praiseworthy and blameworthy.” See: Al-Ghazali’s Revitalization of the Sciences of Religion.Wealth, career and assets are not aims in themselves, but rather tools and means that a Muslim uses for the benefit of this world as well as the Hereafter. If we remember this, wealth will always be in our hands, not our hearts. We will not be desperate for wealth, but rather desperate to please Allah the Almighty with the tools He has given us.3- While seeking wealth, a Muslim must never forget his religious duties.Allah the Almighty says in the Glorious Qur’an, “O you who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children divert you from the remembrance of God, and whoever does that, they are the losers.” (Al-Munafiqun 63:9)In this verse, Allah the Almighty did not forbid us from seeking wealth or children, but rather He forbade us from allowing them to divert us from remembering Him and being steadfast on the duties that He has asked us to fulfill. While seeking a great career, a Muslim should not forget his duties towards Allah the Almighty, his religion – the Ummah, and of course his family. He should never compromise his religion for the sake of this life. Also, one must not do any impermissible job or fall into any impermissible dealings for the sake of supplying himself and his family with the things they desire. The permissible always leads to opulence and bliss.4- Wealth is a trust that requires gratitude and sharing.Allah the Almighty says, “Your wealth and your children are only a temptation, and with God is an immense reward.” (At-Taghabun 64:15)The word ‘temptation’ in this verse means a ‘test.’ We are given blessings and bounties, but do we thank Allah the Almighty for them? Do we remember Allah the Almighty when we are rich? Or do we only remember Him when we fall into hardships? Do we pay the zakah that we are required to give? Do we help the needy? We are tested through bounties such as wealth, to see whether we will misuse them or use them in the right place and in the right way; whether we will thank Allah the Almighty for them or not, and whether we will give the needy their share or not. In this regard, Imam Al-Hasan Al-Basri says, “Allah the Almighty has mercy upon people to whom the world was a trust, so they paid it back to the One who entrusted them with it, and they departed unburdened.”If these four cornerstones are well-rooted in a Muslim’s heart and he continuously evaluates himself accordingly, then indulging in the life of this world will not hinder him in the Hereafter, in sha’ Allah.Allah Almighty knows best."

Here are some of them:1- Hajj revives the spirit of utter love and devotion to the One and Only God by keeping alive the faith, struggle, and path of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Isma`il.2- Hajj helps humans break the many barriers of race, language, ethnicity, and color that divide them, and helps them to create the unity of a single human family based on the recognition of God as the Creator and Sustainer of all creation.3- Hajj helps keep alive the memory of humanity’s final standing for judgment before their Lord and Judge.4- Hajj helps individuals become whole once again after cleansing themselves of the many sins they accumulate over the course of their lives.

Responding to your question, `Abdullah ibn Abdulrahman ibn Jibreen, the late member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas states:Dear brother, here are ten means of keeping on doing good deeds after Ramadan:1- Seek Allah’s support, beseeching Him Almighty to guide you to the right path and help you remain steadfast in faith. Allah Almighty has praised the supplication of those who are of sound instruction when they (have) said, “Our Lord! Cause not our hearts to stray after Thou hast guided us, and bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence. Lo! You, only You are the Bestower.” (Aal `Imran 3:8)2- Be keen on being in the company of the righteous and attending dhikr meetings such as religious lectures or visiting a righteous friend to make dhikr (remembrance of Allah) together.3- Acquire knowledge about the biographies of the Prophet’s Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) and the righteous believers by reading books and listening to tapes. This will stimulate you to keep firm in faith and follow in their footsteps.4- Listen to audio recordings that deal with religious admonitions and righteous speeches.5- Be keen on observing the obligatory acts of worship.6- Keep on offering supererogatory acts of worship; do what you are most inclined to and can do regularly, even if it is little. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “O people! Do only those good deeds which you can do, for Allah does not get tired (of giving reward) till you get tired, and the best deeds to Allah are the incessant ones, even though they may be few.”(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)7- Start learning Allah’s Book by heart. Recite what you have learned during Prayer and keep reciting the Qur’an as much as you can.8- Perform dhikr a lot and ask Almighty Allah for forgiveness. This may seem a tiny good act, yet observing it regularly increases faith and strengthens the heart.9- Keep away from everything that may cause your heart to divert from the right path such as bad people, indecent television programs, pornographic pictures, and love songs.10- Last, but not least in importance, truly repent to Almighty Allah and be keen on not deviating from the right path again. Allah Almighty rejoices when His bondman returns to Him Most High in true repentance.Dear brother, do not be one of those who do not pay heed to Allah Most High except in Ramadan. The righteous predecessors said about them, “Woe to those people who do not become mindful of Almighty Allah but in Ramadan!May Allah help you be steadfast in the right path until you reach the following Ramadan in best health and condition.Allah Almighty knows best.Excerpted, with slight modifications, from, www.islamtoday.com"

I Have No Time for the Kids, Please Help								Wa `alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear sister, let us first commend your question which shows your strong concern about mosques and how to perform the rituals peacefully and quietly.Generally speaking, bringing children to mosques is not only allowed but also advisable in Islam on the condition that they do not cause disturbance or distraction to the worshippers.The community, in cooperation with the imam, should provide proper facilities for kids taking into consideration the importance of endearing mosques to children.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and an Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states,Parents are not allowed to bring their children to mosques if they are in any way distracting the worshippers, and yet the parents are not able to control them.How can they do so, when the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered us not to disturb those who pray even by reading the Qur’an?Having said this, I should also point out that mosques are not allowed to bar the children. We should rather encourage them to frequently join mosques as long as the parents make sure they do not cause any disturbance or distractions for those who pray.During the Prophet’s time, occasionally, parents brought their children to the mosque during the hours of the regular prayers, and hence occasionally the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would cut short his prayers if he would hear an infant’s cry because of his pity for the mother and the baby.Based on this, some scholars are of the view there is nothing wrong in bringing the children to the regular prayers as long as they are not a constant source of distraction.However, this does not mean that they should be bringing children to the mosque for night prayers such as taraweeh or qiyam where imams are supposed to be reading long Surahs and they are supposed to finish their fixed portions of the Qur’an each night in order to complete the entire Qur’an during the month.Bringing children to mosques at these irregular hours would, therefore, be a source of distraction for the imam as well as his followers. Moreover, it would also amount to abusing the children as they are supposed to be in bed at the time.Therefore, it is advisable for the parents not to bring the children to the mosque at such odd hours, while they may do so at other times.Allah Almighty knows best.

Referring to this, Allah Almighty says: “Your Lord has decreed, that you worship none save Him, and (that you show) kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee, say not ‘Fie’ unto them nor repulse them, but speak unto them a gracious word.” (Al-Israa’ 17:23)However, favoring parents and being dutiful to them is not allowed if it involves disobedience to Allah.In his response to the question, Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi, former President of the Islamic Society of North America states:This is an authentic Hadith and it is mentioned in many books of Hadith. In one version reported by Ibn Majah it is mentioned that the Prophet told a person, “Be at your mother’s feet and there is the Paradise.” (Ibn Majah)The meaning of the Hadith is that you should serve your mother and take good care of her. Obey her as long as she does not tell you to do something haram.It does not make any difference whether the mother is Muslim or non-Muslim. It is the duty of the children to be respectful to their parents, especially mothers. Allah says in the Qur’an, “And We have enjoined on man (to be good) to his parents: in travail upon travail did his mother bear him, and in years twain was his weaning: Show gratitude to Me and to thy parents: to Me is (your final) Goal. But if they strive to make thee join in worship with Me things of which you have no knowledge, obey them not; yet bear them company in this life with justice (And consideration), and follow the way of those who turn to Me. In the End the return of you all is to Me, and I will tell you the truth (and meaning) of all that you did.” (Luqman 31:14-15)If the mother is a pious Muslim woman, then she is the woman of Jannah (Paradise) and in her service indeed there is Jannah. But if she is not a pious Muslimah or if she is not a Muslimah, still your Jannah is in her service because you serve her in obedience to Allah. The Jannah of the children is near the feet of their mothers, but the Jannah of the mothers is in their own obedience to Allah.Allah Almighty knows best.Excerpted, with slight modifications, from: www.pakistanlink.com"

Some scholars maintain that the baby’s vomit does cause impurity to parents clothes and the surrounding things.Responding to your question, Dr. Muhammad Salama, PhD in Islamic Studies in English and an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Islamic Science, Al-Madinah International University, states:If the food has not changed and has been vomited as it was eaten, then it is not najasah (ritually impure). If it has changed, then scholars have differed opinions whether it is najasah or not- though those who consider it najasah maintain that if it is little in amount, still it is pardonable.With regard to babies, they usually vomit more than adults and it has not been reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) commanded mothers to avoid it. Therefore, a group of scholars have considered this case pardonable also due to the hardship that mothers would suffer.Allah Almighty knows best."

He Seems Like a Good Guy, But His House is Terrible								Wa `alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear sister, we really appreciate your question that shows your commitment to your kinship relation.Upon the jurists’ agreement, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a non-Muslim man.However, it is advisable, in the case of your sister-in-law, not to completely cut relation with her or boycott her in the hope that she may be convinced one day that she is committing a grave sin and in a great danger.In his response to your question, Dr. Wael Shehab, PhD in Islamic Studies from Al-Azhar University, and currently the Imam of the Downtown Toronto Masjid in Canada, stated,A Muslim woman is not allowed to marry except a Muslim man; there is an agreement among Muslim scholars on this ruling.It is therefore unlawful for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man, regardless of whether he is of the People of the Book or not. Allah Almighty says, “… And do not marry (your girls) to idolaters until they believe…” (Al-Baqarah 2:221)And He said concerning the muhajri (immigrant) Muslim women: “Then if you know them to be Believers, do not send them back to the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them (as wives), nor are they lawful for them (as husbands).” (Al-Mumtahanah 60:10)No text exists which makes exceptions for the People of the Book. Hence, on the basis of the above verses, there is a consensus among Muslims concerning this prohibition.As for the case of your sister-in-law, you are advised to kindly and wisely tell her about this fact. You have to help her to understand that she is seriously violating the rules of Shari`ah if she marries a non-Muslim. A local Muslim scholar, an imam, or close family friends may help in this regard.It is not advised to totally cut relations with her hoping that you may help her change her situation. Also, don’t forget to make du`aa’ for her.May Allah accept your and our good deeds!Allah Almighty knows best."

In his answer to the question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states: Islam commands Muslims to maintain the ties of kinship and be kind to their relatives, it is keen to maintain the rights of each of the spouses in comfort and privacy and protect the marital life against any prospective misgivings or doubts that might eventually terminate it.Your love for your cousin and your desire to help are indeed commendable. It is our Islamic duty to do what we can to foster ties of kinship.But at the same time, you must know that in Islam we have priorities that we must observe. We are not supposed to act based purely on our feelings or emotions, but based on sound thinking and understanding.If your wife is objecting to your cousin living with you in the same house, she is quite justified in doing so. She has every right to safeguard her privacy in her own house; and as a husband, it is your duty to provide such privacy and comfort for your wife.Moreover, if your cousin lives with you, there may be situations where she would be isolated with him, which may give rise to complications and misgivings.The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) has, therefore, warned us strictly against such matters.

Insurance is not permissible, according to majority, because as an exchange contract it contains gharar (ambiguity) with regard to its final outcome (in this example how many payments of pension you will receive because we do not know when one is going to die).If Islamic insurance is available, you should go for it. If it is not available and you need really insurance (any kind of insurance), you may go for conventional insurance provided you avoid riba (interest). Any pension insurance contract  done with any insurance company is based solely on interest in addition to the probability of life expectancy because you pay now an amount of money and they give you back an annual or periodical amount, the difference is interest.This does not include two kinds of pensions: the obligatory pension that is done in many countries like the social security in America and the employment pension that many companies have for their workers.

Moreover, He, the Exalted, is pleased with that one more than the mother who finds her lost child after getting despaired of finding him.2- Sincere repentance annuls and expiates the previous sins whatever they were as long as one shows sincere feelings and really returns to Allah keeping stick to the right path and practising Islam practically.3- When a Muslim gets depressed, he should not abandon the acts of worship, rather he should draw himself closer to Allah Almighty by performing even more worships and praying to Him to make things easy for him.Saying this, we are not assuming that a Muslim is completely free from all what he or she had committed in the past. But, let us say, he is starting a new page. Hence, he should spare no effort in obeying Allah Almighty via performing his religious duties especially the obligatory ones (fara’id) like prayers.In short, we congratulate you on your repentance and returning to your Lord. We can, also, say that “YES”, it is possible to become a good Muslim in spite of all you have done. This is not a personal opinion, rather it is what we perceive from our noble Shari`ah that Allah is the All Forgiving Who forgives anyone whatever he has done. There are many verses in the Qur’an and many Hadiths that assure this concept.So, go ahead, repent sincerely for what you have done, draw yourself closer to Allah Almighty, and call Him eagerly to accept you and forgive you for your previous mistakes.May Allah Almighty forgive you, and us, and guide us all to His right path, amen.Allah Almighty knows best."

Investment With Borrowed Money: Allowed?								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Many jurists argue that it is prohibited to buy, own/hold or sell stocks of companies that makes any prohibited transaction whatsoever.2- A group of jurists argue for an exception at this time and until a time when there will be reasonable number of halal stocks available to absorb the investments of Muslims,In his response to your question, Prof. Dr. Monzer Kahf, Professor of Islamic Finance and Economics at Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, states:In the first place, I should stress that Islam prohibits interest and certain other practices that contain any immoral or unfair ingredients such as gambling, unbalanced transactions, ambiguous contracts, etc.This prohibition includes that a Muslim must abstain from such practices as an individual as well as a partner in a company, meaning that if a Muslim enters in a company with others, Muslims/non-Muslims, a Muslim must always be keen that other partners do not indulge in any non-permitted transaction because the management of a company acts on behalf of its owners.Accordingly, many jurists argue that it is prohibited to buy, own/hold or sell stocks of companies that makes any prohibited transaction whatsoever. But a group of jurists, whose opinion is respected, argue that this ruling poses a great deal of inconvenience and hardship on many Muslims, especially in the West and other non-Muslim countries because there are only a few stocks that comply with it such as stocks of Islamic banks and a few other small companies, even these are not available for the greatest majority of Muslims.And since hardship always calls for relaxation, they argue for exceptionality at this time and until a time when there will be reasonable number of halal stocks available to absorb the investments of Muslims, which may be even theoretically a long time. Yet, this exception has certain conditions that can be summarized in three groups:a– The company’s main line of activity must not be haram in itself such as interest-based banks and insurance companies and Las Vegas type entertainment business, etc.b– The degree of involvement in prohibited transaction must not be high, and here they argue that depending on interest-based loans, maintaining high percentage on receivables that in most of the times carry interest and having high percentage of interest in the company’s net income or giving donations to prohibited causes, etc. may be indications that should be considered, obviously the ideal is zero on all these, but one may say that 5%, 10%, 25%, 33% or the like may not to be a high to induce the prohibition on any or some of these points.c– There always must be active process of cleaning your investment, i.e., to do away with the income that results from prohibited transactions by giving it to charity since according to the Shari’ah you really do not own it, and remember you are, Allah willing, rewarded for this action of cleaning but not as a Sadaqah nor Zakah.Thus, investing according to these indices or stocks in them is on one hand an exception of the basic principle and on the other hand calls for cleaning your income, both from dividend and price increment that may have resulted from Shari`ah unlawful activity of the company.To my knowledge, the listing in these indices is updated every three or six months, and if you have old information on a specific stock you may look in the web of that company and see if there was any substantial change in its fundamentals, balance sheet and income statement from the previous period when it was listed, if the change is not substantial, you may work on the assumption that it has not changed since during the period of comparison, this is not easy, is it?Zakah on stocks: the opinion of the majority of the contemporary jurists is that if stocks are purchased for the purpose of capital gains, i.e., watching prices and get an opportunity to sell, even after split, at higher prices, especially if the idea is done in the short run, stocks are then objects of trade and they are subject to Zakah at the market value on the day a lunar year is complete from the day a nisab is owned.This market value is added to your other Zakatable assets, like cash and bank accounts, and Zakah is due at 2.5% of the total if it is nisab or above. This means whatever dividend you got during the year is actually included (when it is either used for new stocks or other Zakatable assets) unless was used for consumption (whether used up like food or durable like a refrigerator and both are exempt from Zakah).But if stocks are used for income (their dividends), the Zakah is due only on a percentage of the stocks’ value that equals the percentage of the net mobile assets (inventory + cash on hand and in banks + receivables and similar payables) to total equity of the company.In all cases, if it is difficult to calculate the Zakatable amount at the lunar year, then you may take the figures from the Gregorian (solar) year and compensate for the difference by adjusting the rate of Zakah from 2.5% to 2.577% (= 2.5% + 2.4% multiplied by 354/365).Besides this opinion, there is a view that only the income (dividends) of stocks held for their income is subject to Zakah at a rate of 10% in similarity with agricultural land and products. I believe that this view is weak and cannot be substantiated by the rules of Usual Al-Fiqh or the principles of Islamic Jurisprudence nor by the Fiqh rules.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

Ex-Wife Against Teaching Islam to My Daughter								

 

How Did The Prophet Prepare for Ramadan?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother, thanks for this interesting question; we really commend your keenness on knowing the Islamic teachings that regulate man’s affairs. May Allah help us keep firm on the Right Path!With regard to Islam’s stance on poverty and wealth, the following is the statement issued by a prominent Muslim scholar:Islam does not go against the fact that a clear distinction exists between human beings in terms of property and means of sustenance, this is the nature of life, which is in the form of stairs; some people on the top while others at the bottom.Thus, it is no strange to witness disparity in people’s income and wealth since such distinction exists in other highly valued gifts of grace, like intellect, beauty, physical strength and other things that characterize every individual. On this aspect, Almighty Allah says: “And Allah hath favored some of you above others in provision.”(An-Nahl 16:71)So, it is fact of life that some people are given preeminence over others in terms of material gains, as Allah Almighty says: “We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in rank that some of them may take labor from others.”(Az-Zukhruf 43:32)However, this does not mean that those who have upper hands in everything should abuse this power in exploiting their subordinates; not at all, this is not the theme of the mentioned Qur’anic verse. Rather, what Allah means in that verse is that those endowed with extraordinary gifts should make use of it in catering for the interest of others and for development.For more elaboration on this issue, we can portray the life as a big factory where division of labor is put into practice in order to run the factory successfully. But it must be borne in mind that as Islam sanctions the principle of having distinction in material gains, it does not approve of having wealth as the monopoly of certain individuals, that is why it shows great keenness on bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots in order to prevent the rich from oppressing the poor, and to upgrade the living condition of people, for all this will help create stability and shields against enmity and friction between members of the same society. That is why Islam strictly condemns that wealth should be under the control of some individuals to the detriment of the majority. Thus, to avert these dangerous effects, it sets down the following principles:1- Forbidding all unlawful means of money investment, such as riba (usury or interest), monopoly of wealth, fraudulent deals, unlawful trades, and so on. The motive behind this is to limit the act of investing money as not to lead to widening the gap between the rich and the poor.Enjoining Zakah (obligatory charity) on the rich; to take a portion of their wealth and give it to the poor. The system of Zakah, set down by Islam, is just to help the poor find means of sustenance through what they receive from Zakah, be it in2- Enjoining Zakah (obligatory charity) on the rich; to take a portion of their wealth and give it to the poor. The system of Zakah, set down by Islam, is just to help the poor find means of sustenance through what they receive from Zakah, be it in the form of annual payments or through granting them permanent financial security.Imam An-Nawawi and other Shafi`i scholars say in this regard: “Every needy person has to be granted what will sustain him and instill in him some sort of constant financial security. This ranges according to each individual’s need: a worker, whose main concern is how to get equipment for his work, must be assisted in obtaining such equipment no matter how costly it is. A trader, in need of capital, must be given money to carry on his business. But this assistance should be within the range of acquiring profits that will sustain him. As for a person who does not know how to make a living through business or profession, he should be given some sort of life means of sustenance; this can be done by giving him money that will help him purchase a land from which he will earn a living.”Zakah in this way is a perfect means of increasing the number of propertied classes among the poor, for as we have seen, it caters for every individual to purchase means of production: equipment for workers, land for farmers, shops for traders and businessmen, and estates for others through which they will earn a living; in fact, Zakah brings nothing but good for all! But it is compulsory for those in charge of Zakah to manage it in a proper way that will bring benefit for all people.3- Besides Zakah, Islam also enjoins on the rich some other monetary assistance, such as relatives maintenance, fulfilling vows and religious duties of expiation (for law violations), Al-Udhiyah (or `Eid sacrifice) (which Hanafi jurists deem obligatory), good neighborliness and maintaining ties of kinship, good hospitality, feeding the poor, assisting the distressed, releasing the prisoners, providing medical care for the sick and rending assistance during calamities, like wars, starvation and so on. All this is in pursuance of the hadith:“He will never be deemed a true believer, he who fails to aid his starving neighbor, despite his affordability to do so.”4- Islamic rules of inheritance are also an indirect means of having a just distribution of wealth. Also serving the same function is well made for people who have no share in one’s bequest. That is deemed obligatory according to some early Muslim scholars on the ground of Allah’s words: “It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if he leave any goods, that he make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing.” (Al-Baqarah 2:180)This is the basis of what is known as the law of “Compulsory Will” meant to assist grandchildren whose father passes away while their grandpa is alive.  Moreover, in addition to all what is mentioned,5- Moreover, in addition to all what is mentioned, a Muslim ruler is given discretion to make some interference in creating balance to the economy by distributing some portion of public property to some people who are in dire need of assistance. This is clearly different from expropriation of property, which is also lawful if it follows Islamic guidance. We have a good example in the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on this aspect. It happened that the Prophet (peace be upon him) distributedAl-Fay’ (i.e. war booty received without fighting) belonging to Bani An-Nadeer, to Al-Muhajireen (Muslim emigrants) solely, excluding the Al-Ansar (Al-Madinah Helpers) save two Ansari men who happened to be very poor. The reason for this Prophetic act was due to the condition of Al-Muhajireen who were forced to leave Makkah, leaving behind all their properties. Thus upon reaching Al-Madinah, there was some sort of wide gap between Al Muhajireen and Al-Ansar in terms of wealth, for the majority of the latter were in good condition owning immense property. So to bridge this gap, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) introduced the mentioned economic measures to stabilize this situation, and a Qur’anic verse was later revealed to endorse the Prophet’s action, as Allah says: “that it become not a commodity between the rich among you.” (Al-Hashr 59:7)So, all Muslim rulers have to follow this good example laid down by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).”Almighty Allah knows best."

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear questioner, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake.You still have to make up the days that you owe of Ramadan, and your duties cannot be discharged except by doing that.Elaborating more on this, we would like to cite the following fatwa published on www.islamqa.info:There are many hadiths about the virtues of Hajj which indicate that it erases sins and expiates for bad deeds, and the individual returns from it (free of sin) as on the day his mother bore him.But this virtue and reward does not mean that obligatory duties are waived, whether they are duties owed to Allah, may He be exalted, such as expiations and fulfillment of vows, or duties that one has not yet fulfilled, such as zakah that he has not paid or fasts that he has to make up, or duties owed to other people, such as debts and the like. Hajj brings forgiveness of sins, but it does not mean that these duties are waived, according to scholarly consensus.If a person delays making up Ramadan fasts, for example, and that is without an excuse, then he does Hajj and it is accepted, his Hajj brings forgiveness for the sin of delaying, but the obligation to make up those days is not waived.Imam Ad-Dumayri said:“In the sound hadith we read “Whoever performs Hajj and does not utter obscenities or commit sin, will emerge from his sins as on the day his mother bore him.” This has to do specifically with sins realted to the rights of Allah, may He be exalted, in particular, and not the rights of other people. The duties themselves are not waived. So if a person owes prayer, expiations and other rights of Allah, may He be exalted, they are not waived, because they are duties, not sins; rather the sin is delaying them. So the delay is waived by Hajj, but the duty itself is not. If he delays it after that, the sin is renewed. So an accepted Hajj brings forgiveness for the sin of non-compliance, but does not waive the duties themselves.” (Kashf al-Qina`2/522)Allah Almighty knows best."

[This is] the essence of riba (usury).” (Al-Bukhari)The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stated that giving more quantity, when exchanging goods of the same kind, due to the difference in quality, is the essence of riba, which is not permissible.However, the Messenger of Allah, as was his habit, pointed out the permissible way. The Prophet told him to sell the bad dates for cash money and then buy the good dates with that money.Accordingly, we say: If a woman has some worn-out gold or gold that people no longer wear, she can sell it in the market and take the money, and then buy new gold of her choosing. This is the way taught by our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

I’m Ill, I Need Love, But My Husband Ignores Me								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:There is no authentic evidence for the supplications you have mentioned. However, you can recite any part of the Qur’an as a therapy and ruqyah.With regard to your question, late Sheikh Muhammad `Ali Al-Hanooti, a former member of the Fiqh Council of North America, stated,We don’t have any authentic narrations for any of those purposes, but we believe that any recitation of Qur’an could help with cure and therapy. This is based on what was narrated in Sahih Al-Bukhari that a man was bitten by a snake when the Companions of the Prophet were on a trip. The man asked them to recite Qur’an over the wound for cure, and it worked.The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to say supplications for what is known as ruqyah (protective supplications). You can make any du`aa’ for any patient as well as you can recite Qur’an over him. Everything of that would do and be of help.Sheikh Hamed Al-`Ali, instructor of Islamic Culture at the Faculty of Education, Kuwait and Imam of Dahiat As-Sabahiyya Mosque, adds,There is no specific evidence that mentions a particular merit of reciting Surat Al-Muzaammil for the patient in order to seek recovery. However, the whole Qur’an is a cure for all diseases.As for the second part of the question, here are some suggestions for seeking recovery for a sick child:1- The best you can do when your child is sick is to place your hand on the child’s head and recite Surat Al-Fatihah seven times and blow with a little bit from your saliva on the child after each recitation.2- Recite the two protective Surahs, Al-Falaq and An-Nas (Chapters 113 and 114), each one three times.Also, you can say the following du`aa’:Allahumma rabba an-nas adhhibi al-ba’sa, ishfi anta ash-shafi la shifa’a illa shifa’uka, shifa’an la yughadiru saqaman(O Allah, O Lord of Mankind, remove the affliction and send down cure and healing, for no one can cure but You; so cure in such a way that no trace of illness is left).Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

How to Cope With Ramadan, Exams, and Distractions?‏								Wa `alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother, thanks for your question. May Allah bless those who seek knowledge to dispel the clouds of ignorance.When a person performs `Umrah during the months of Hajj and then performs Hajj in the same year, thus enjoying the state of removing the ritual consecration in between, this practice is called Tamattu`. But the point here is that one should assume ihram for `Umrah during the specified months of Hajj, not before them.Answering this question, the Standing Committee for Islamic Research and Ifta’, stated,First, if a person assumes ihram for `Umrah at the end of Ramadan; performs Tawaf and Sa`i only on the first night of Shawwal; performs Tahallul (removal of the state of ihram) after finishing the `Umrah; and afterwards performs Hajj in the same year, this is not considered Tamattu` because this person’s ihram for `Umrah was not assumed during the months of Hajj.Second, as for the person who assumes ihram for `Umrah after bypassing the Miqat and then performs `Umrah and travels to Madina and then assumes ihram again at the Miqat for another `Umrah and performs it, this second `Umrah does not cancel the first required damm he or she had to offer to expiate assuming ihram beyond the Miqat for the first `Umrah.May Allah grant us success, and may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, Muhammad, and his family and Companions.Allah Almighty knows best."

How to Overcome Porn Addiction								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa BarakatuhIn the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:Here are some practical steps for your brother:1- Let him convince himself that the pleasure that he derives from homosexuality  is in reality nothing but pain and suffering in the long term.2- Let him continuously read, reflect and meditate on the verses of the Quran that deal with the punishment meted to the nation who practiced this abomination.3- Let him ask himself whether he wishes to belong to the group of the wicked sinners condemned by Allah or join the company of the prophets, saintly ones, the martyrs and the righteous who are blessed by Allah.4- Let him immediately cut off all relations with people who lead such a life-style.5- Let him meditate on the ephemeral and transient nature of this world.6- Let him make dhikr and duaa his constant companion.7- Last but not least, once he has repented and changed himself into a better person, he should get married and seek a lawful Islamic relationship.In his response to the question in point, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto,Ontario, Canada, states:Muslim scholars agree — based on what has been revealed in the Quran and what has been authenticated in the Prophetic Sunnah — that homosexual behavior (gayness and lesbianism) is prohibited.This is because homosexual behavior is an assault on the humanity of a person, destruction of the family, and a clash with the aims of the Lawgiver, one of which is the establishment of sexual instincts between males and females so as to encourage the institution of marriage.Your brother is not at all different from those who have been conditioned to fornicate, or commit theft or murder, or who have become addicted to watching pornography or even television for that matter.All of these are destructive habits that one learns through continuous exposure or conditioning. So he must ask himself whether he would prefer to continue in this destructive behavior or change himself?If he is a Muslim, he is left with no choice but to change. For homosexuality is considered one of the most abominable sins in Islam; it is so enormous in intensity and gravity that Allah tells us in the Quran that because of it, an entire nation was destroyed by Allah in a most horrible way.We must know that the stories narrated in the Qur’an are not meant for chanting or entertainment; rather they are meant to teach us valuable lessons for our benefit.Allah says:{Truly in their stories is a lesson for people of understanding, for this (Book) is not a forged tale, but is a confirmation of the revelations of that preceded it, a detailed explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy to people who believe.} (Yusuf 12:111)So your brother should ask himself whether he wishes to belong to the category of those who have been condemned to eternal perdition by Allah.The choice is his and his alone; he cannot say, “I don’t have any choice.”The sin of the one who abused your brother is his alone; he will surely meet his Creator for his sin. But his sin does not justify your brother’s, for your brother is a free person with his own choice and will.If he really believes in Allah, and convinces himself sufficiently of the need to change, and motivates himself by reading and reflecting and thinking of standing before the Lord of the worlds, he will be able to break free of any such destructive habits.Islam is full of examples of those who were addicted to all sorts of crimes and sins, but eventually they changed their lives around by affirming faith and commitment in Allah and working diligently upon themselves.The Arabs before Islam were addicted to drinking, womanizing and all kinds of vices, and yet after having embraced Islam, they became a better breed of people, breaking free of all such vices.So I advise your brother to summon and mobilize all his spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and practical resources to break free of this most destructive and abominable habit and learn new positive habits that are pleasing to Allah.Here are a few tips to help him in his struggle:1- Let him convince himself that the pleasure that he derives from such an abominable behavior is in reality nothing but pain and suffering in the long term. So, instead of associating this behavior with pleasure, let him learn to associate and link it with pain; so every time he is tempted to do it, let him picture the pain and suffering of hell fire. By repeatedly going through this exercise, he will eventually come to abhor and shun this behavior altogether.2- Let him continuously read, reflect and meditate on the verses of the Qur’an that deal with the punishment meted to the nation who practiced this abomination; let him also read the verses depicting hell fire. (For instance: Qur’an 7: 80-84; 11:77-83; 40:47-50, etc.)3- Let him ask himself whether he wishes to belong to the group of the wicked sinners condemned by Allah or join the company of the prophets, saintly ones, the martyrs and the righteous who are blessed by Allah. The choice is his and his alone.4- Let him immediately cut off all relations with people who lead such a life-style; let him, if there is need, relocate himself to another city where he will be able to erase his past and form friendships with those who are righteous and engaged in good works and thus occupy himself in such works with them.5- Let him meditate on the ephemeral and transient nature of this world. The pleasures of this world are fleeting while the pleasure and pain of Hereafter are everlasting.6- Let him make dhikrand duaa his constant companion. By seeking Allah’s help to fight this behavior, he can surely overcome and break free of this abomination. Allah has promised to come to the help of those who strive in His way: {As for those who strive for Our sake, We will guide them unto Our ways; verily, Allah is with those who behave with excellence.} (Al-`Ankabut 29:69)7- Last but not least, once he has repented and changed himself into a better person, he should get married and seek a lawful Islamic relationship, which will be approved by Allah as well as rewarded by Him. May Allah help us all to hate disbelief and sins in all forms, and may He make dear to our hearts faith and righteous actions, amen.

The Teachers Are Trying to Ruin Us								Wa `alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Marital relationship is something peculiar and should be kept between only the husband and wife.2- No third party can be involved in this very private relationship.3- It is not allowed for husband and wife to have intimate relationship in the presence of a third party, and that is why it is not permissible for one of the conjoined twins to get married.Regarding this issue, the Islamic Research Academy at Al-Azhar issued the following resolution on Thursday, March 27, 2008:It is not permissible for one of the conjoined twins or both to get married from another person. The reason of prohibition in this case is that marriage has requirements and marital affairs that one of the conjoined twins is not allowed to watch.It should be noted that the conjoined twins are not considered one person, and it is not permissible for a person to marry from two female conjoined twins as this is considered as combining between two sisters in marriage.Therefore, the marriage of conjoined twins is contradictory to the rulings of the Islamic Shari`ah in all cases.Moreover, the eminent Muslim scholar and renowned da`iyah Sheikh `Abdel Khaliq Hasan Ash-Shareef states:In marriage, spouses display their `awrahs before each other as Almighty Allah permitted husband and wife to have intimate relationship, the thing that is not allowed to be done in the presence of a third party other than the husband and wife. It is clear that the conjoined twins are two persons, and we wonder how what the case would be if one of them married another person.Therefore, the marriage of one of the conjoined twins to another person is not allowed unless they get separated surgically.Also, Dr. Rif`at Fawzi, former Professor of Shari`ah at Cairo Univ., adds:This marriage is not permissible before conducting surgical separation between the conjoined twins. The reason of prohibition is that it is not allowed for a third party (i.e. other than the husband and wife) to see the married couple while having intimate relationship or displaying their `awrahs.Almighty Allah knows best."

How Does a New Muslim Prepare for Ramadan?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.
In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:A Muslim should spare no efforts to please Allah Almighty and draw himself closer to Him. As a new Muslim, you are best advised to encircle yourself with good Muslim friends who could help you become a good practicing Muslim. You could get rid of all bad habits by means of patience, resolve, and engagement in good work, and professional counselling when necessary.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:Since you have been addicted to an extremely pernicious habit that destroys your spiritual soul and thus leads to self-destruction, you must urgently summon your will power and take all the necessary steps in order to wean yourself of it immediately.In order to empower yourself to achieve this, you should seek counseling and therapy, preferably from those professionals in the field who are conscientious Muslims.If such Muslim professionals are not available, choose one from those who are ethically and morally conscious. It is important for you to wean yourself of these pernicious habits.The consequences of persisting in them are simply unthinkable; they would undoubtedly corrode your spiritual soul and cause your spiritual death.Sins by their very nature are addictive, for it is in the very nature of the carnal self to seek pleasure in sins.As Al-Busiri has rightly said,“The carnal self is a like a baby; if you neglect him, he will grow up clinging on to the breast-milk forever, but if you wean him off, he will be weaned off.”I suggest a few tips which you can use to empower yourself:1- Visualize and meditate on the ugliness of this heinous sin and conjure up images of hell fire as painted in the Qur’an and the Sunnah as many times as possible until such time that whenever you are tempted to visit such websites or read such magazines, the scenes of hell fire will be playing in your mind.Thus, even as you have associated this addiction with pleasure, you will come to associate it with pure pain and suffering.2- Convince yourself of the urgency of removing this malignant cancer from your life by taking all measures such as listing all the negative things about such habits, and listing the verses and traditions about the gravity of sins. Remember it is far more serious than cancer attacking your body, since your soul survives you even after your physical body has disintegrated in the earth.3- Imagine how terrible a loss you will be facing were you to die while being addicted to this most heinous sin.4- Seek strength from Allah by crying to Him for succor. But you can never seek the help of Allah unless you seek to establish connection with Him through regular Prayers, so never be slack in your Prayers.5- Schedule your time in such a way that you are never left with any time to think of such matters.Imam Ash-Shafi`i said,“If you don’t occupy your mind with good works, your carnal self will make you busy in bad deeds!”6- Surround yourself with spiritual and Islamic influences and virtually immerse yourself in them.7- Always hang around with good Muslims who are busy doing good works; join a halaqah(study circle) where spiritual training is imparted together with the study of Islam.8- Make your mind and tongue busy with dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Say the following words and others frequently:Subhan Allah; al-hamdu lillah; laa ilaha illa Allah; Allahu akbar;Wa laa hawla wala quwwata illa billah. Astaghfir Allaha al-azhim min kulli dhanbin wa atubu ilaihi.(Glory be to Allah; praise be to Allah; there is no god but Allah; Allah is Greatest. There is no power or strength except by the will of Allah. I ask forgiveness of Allah from all my sins and repent to Him.)9- Once you have been weaned of these pernicious habits, you should seriously consider marriage; marriage is the protection against temptations.I pray that the Beneficent Lord of Mercy save us all from the evil inclinations of our souls and make us hate disbelief, transgressions and sins; and may He endear to our hearts faith and good works.

What Are the Characteristics of Islamic Dawah?								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother, let us express our sincere thanks to you for your eagerness to ask this question and we implore Almighty Allah to guide us all to His straight path and support you in your noble work!Practicing da`wah (inviting people to Islam) is not an easy task; it is the work of Allah’s Prophets and Messengers, so you have to follow their path and be patient.However, the best advice for you is that you need to increase your knowledge regarding the different Islamic schools of thought, especially that adopted by your community.Responding to your question, Dr. Hatem Al-Hajj, Dean of College of Islamic Studies, Mishkah University, stated,My dear brother, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Allah never sent a prophet unless he was a shepherd.” (Al-Bukhari)This was a preparation by Allah, so that the Prophets develop the qualities of gentleness, patience, and forbearance. You will need those qualities for the rest of your life as an imam of a mosque and a shepherd of a community, so you need to strive to acquire these qualities and enhance them.I advise myself and you to:1- Avoid discrediting any advice before thoroughly examining it using the Qur’an and Sunnah, in line with the practice of the greatest generations and the greatest imams, including the four founders of the four madhhabs.2- Know that Islam does not have a hierarchy of authority like the papal hierarchy. Although it may seem at times that this can lead to anarchy, it is still of the greatest beauties of Islam, which came to liberate the human intellect and bring down all barriers between humans and their Lord. So, be patient with your community.3- Increase your knowledge, for this religion of ours is based on evidence, while judgment comes from texts of the revelation. Therefore, you will be able to guide your community better and make people listen to you more if you arm yourself with the sublime guidance of the Qur’an and Sunnah.4- Learn the various opinions of Muslim scholars, because this will help you broaden your knowledge and allow you to see the reason behind their ijtihad(personal reasoning). You may choose one opinion, but you should be tolerant of other opinions, as long as they are founded on a correct method of deduction.Finally, you need to know that you cannot please all people, but you can most verily please Allah, so look ahead and do your best and you will find a Merciful Judge in the hereafter. May Allah give you resolve and greatly reward you.Allah Almighty knows best."

Dear sister in Islam, thanks a lot for your question, which reflects your care to have a clear view of the teachings of Islam. Allah commands Muslims to refer to people of knowledge to become well acquainted with the teachings of Islam in all aspects of life.First of all, we would like to make it clear that reading the Glorious Qur’an entails great merits. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one letter of the Book of Allah will have one hasanah (reward) for doing so, and every hasanah will be multiplied by 10. I do not say that ‘alif, lam, mim’ is one letter, but ‘alif’ is a letter, ‘lam’ is a letter and ‘mim’ is a letter.’” (At-Tirmidhi)Responding to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:Recitation of the Qur’an is permitted throughout each and every day, even during the times when optional prayers are prohibited.The only consideration to be made is regarding the prostration of recitation or Sujud At-Tilawah as some scholars (Hanafi persuasion, etc.) prohibit prostration during the times that prayer is prohibited. The majority of scholars do not find anything wrong in reciting Qur’an at anytime, as the hadith texts relating to prohibited times of worship only refer to Prayer. If reciting the Qur’an had been intended, it would have been clearly stated.”Almighty Allah knows best.Source: www.islam.ca"

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Gelatin is a brittle substance extracted by boiling bones, hoofs, and animal tissues. So it depends on the animal itself.2- If it is an animal whose meat is halal, such as cow, camel, sheep and so on, then gelatin is halal, and so is the case with all foods prepared from it.3- However, if the animal is of haram meat such as pigs, then the gelatin made of it is unlawful.As far as the Islamic ruling on gelatin is concerned, Dr. Su`ad Salih, Professor of Fiqh at Al-Azhar Univ., states:Almighty Allah has blessed His servants by creating all kinds of provision on earth for them and He has permitted them to eat everything that is halal (permissible) and good.Allah says:“O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! He is an open enemy for you.” (Al-Baqarah 2:168)However, Allah forbids a limited number of foods that are bad and can be detrimental to one’s health.He Almighty says:“Say: I find not in that which is revealed unto me naught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh for that verily is foul or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than Allah. But whose is compelled (thereto), neither craving nor transgressing (for him) Lo! Your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.” (Al-An`aam 6:145)The Prophet (peace be upon him) has forbidden Muslims to eat any carnivorous animal with fangs and any bird having talons. (Muslim)He is also reported to have forbidden the flesh of domesticated donkeys. (Al-Bukhari)Gelatin is a brittle substance extracted by boiling bones, hoofs, and animal tissues. So it depends on the animal itself. If it is an animal whose meat is halal, such as cow, camel, sheep and so on, then gelatin is halal, and so is the case with all foods prepared from it. However, if the animal is of haram meat such as pigs, then the gelatin made of it is unlawful.Thus, gelatin is halal unless it is derived from an animal whose meat is hram to consume. This is the ruling on gelatin extracted from animals.As for vegetable and artificial gelatin, they are halal and there is nothing wrong in eating and using them.As for gelatin extracted from animals that have not been slaughtered according to Shari`ah, Sheikh `Abdus-Sattar F. Sa`eed, Professor of the Exegesis of the Qur’an at Al-Azhar Univ., states:If the animal is slaughtered by one of the People of the Scripture, or if the butcher is unknown, then the meat is halal and the gelatin is halal too.However, if the animal is slaughtered by means of electric shock, suffocation, and other unlawful ways, then the meat is haram and gelatin is haram too, because it is a product of that unlawful animal.Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

How Can Your Hajj Be Accepted?								

 

Is There Zakah on the Money Saved for Hajj?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- A person is obliged to perform Hajj as soon as he or she is able to because he/she may be prevented from doing so later due to exigencies.2- If one is physically and financially capable of performing Hajj and does not do so, then he is committing a sin by postponing this obligation for no just cause.With regard to your question, Dr. `Abdel-Fattah Idrees, Professor of Comparative Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) at Al-Azhar University, answers:Muslim Jurists have unanimously agreed that Hajj is obligatory upon anyone who is able to perform it, based on the verse in which Allah the Almighty says: “Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah, those who can afford the journey…” (Aal `Imran 3:97)This is also based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “He who intends to make Hajj, let him do so expeditiously, for he or she may fall sick, lose his/her mount (i.e. he/she may lose the ability to bear the expenses of the journey), or he/she may be prevented by some other exigency.” (Ibn Majah)This means that a person is obliged to perform Hajj as soon as he or she is able to because he/she may be prevented from doing so later due to exigencies.If one is physically and financially capable of performing Hajj and does not do so, then he is committing a sin by postponing this obligation for no just cause. This is the view held by the majority of jurists.On the basis of the foregoing evidence, there is a juristic consensus that Hajj should be performed without delay as long as one is able to do so by himself or herself. If not, he or she can send someone to perform it on his or her behalf.However, the followers of the Shafi`i School of Fiqh are of the opinion that Hajj may be performed at any time during one’s lifetime, and there is nothing wrong if one who is obliged to perform Hajj delays it until a later date.They argue that although Hajj was prescribed in the year 6 A.H., the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), delayed it until 10 A.H..Moreover, he sent a delegation from Madinah for Hajj and appointed Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) as its head.Had it been obligatory to perform Hajj earlier, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would never have delayed it if he had had the ability to perform it.However, the majority of jurists maintain that the reason the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not perform Hajj in the year 9 and delayed it until the year 10 was because he was either sick, not financially able, or had some other reasons that prevented him from performing it.Thus, according to the view of the majority of scholars, Hajj is obligatory as soon as one is able to undertake the journey. This means that if one delays Hajj after being able to, he or she will be committing a sin.Almighty Allah knows best."

Lessons to Learn from Hajj								In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:According to some scholars, it is permissible for a woman in her waiting period to stay wherever she wishes, and it is not prohibited for her to make hajj or Umrah during her waiting period.Answering your question, Dar Al-Ifta Al-Misriyyah, states:It is established in Islamic law that a wife whose husband passes away must observe a waiting period of four months and ten days.God Almighty says: “And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind – they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten [days]. And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner. And God is [fully] acquainted with what you do.” (Al-Baqarah 2: 234)Al-Furai`a bint Malik ibn Sinan, Abu Sa’id al-Khudri’s sister (may God be pleased with them), said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered her to remain in her house until the end of her waiting period. This was recorded by Imam Malik in his al-Muwatta`, al-Shafi`i, Ahmad, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa`i, and Ibn Majah. Ibn Habban and al-Hakim declared it authentic.The predecessors differed on whether remaining in the home is among the requirements of the waiting period. The majority of jurists from among the Predecessors and Successors maintained that a woman in her waiting period must remain in her house and it is impermissible for her to go out for hajj or for any other reason basing their opinion on the above hadith.However, it was reported through some of the Companions and their students that it is not obligatory for a woman to remain in her home upon the death of her husband. According to them, it is permissible for a woman in her waiting period to stay wherever she wishes, and it is not prohibited for her to make hajj or Umrah during her waiting period.This opinion was reported from Ali ibn Abi Talib, `Abdullah ibn Abbas, ‘A`ishah and Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may God be pleased with them) from among the Companions.It is also the opinion of Hassan al-Basri, Jabir ibn Zayd, and ‘Ata` ibn Abu Rabah, as well as the Zahirite scholars.They based their opinion on the fact that the verse legislates the obligatory nature of the waiting period yet does not stipulate that a woman remain in her house. Unlike the majority of scholars, they contended that the above hadith is weak and, even if it were sound, it applied to a specific incident and cannot be generalized.Though the opinion of the majority of scholars is preponderant because it is based on a sound hadith, it is conditioned on the legal principles: “Objections are not for issues where there is a difference of opinion, but in matters where there is an agreement,” and “It is permissible to follow the opinion of those who maintain permissibility when there is a need.”It is permissible to follow the opinion of those from among the Predecessors on the matter relating to obligatory hajj, especially for a woman who may not have another opportunity or one who has already paid the exorbitant expenses of hajj.Almighty Allah knows best.Source: http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=1340&text=hajj"
http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-the-scholar/dhikr-supplication/gathering-to-read-the-quran-sunnah/,"Dear scholars, as-salamu `alaykum. Can I get some clarification on the practice of khatm, which involves gathering people together to read the entire Qur’an and make du`aa’ (supplication) in the presence of a religious or pious person such as a hafizh (one who has memorized the Qur’an) with the belief that his presence might bring greater barakah (spiritual grace) to the gathering or believing that the du`aa’ thus made will be more likely be carried by the angels and accepted by Allah. To my understanding, there is nothing wrong in a gathering where the Qur’an is recited; this is a good thing which, I understand, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) recommended and encouraged. However, the idea that having a pious person who has great Islamic knowledge present to bring greater barakah—is it bid`ah (innovation) and maybe a form of shirk, as it suggests that this person’s presence might bring us closer to Allah or may bring greater blessings from Him? Also, could I get clarification about the practice of gathering for khatm, where after having read the Qur’an and offering a du`aa’ for the deceased, they offer food and people eat the same while believing that such food has been blessed.","Related Topics

What Duaa to Say When Breaking Fast?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- The Qur’an is the source of guidance, mercy, illumination, and healing for the faithful at all times.2- There is nothing wrong as far as the Islamic Shari`ah is concerned in gathering to read the Qur’an, as this is a richly rewarded act of devotion.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:Gathering people to read the Qur’an in the presence of a person who is pious and knowledgeable cannot be considered an innovation so long as it is not done with the intention of taking him as an intermediary in the worship of Allah, the One and only God.In order to form a better perspective on this issue, the following must be kept in mind:Reading the Qur’an, unless someone has made a fixed ritual, is considered highly rewarded: the Qur’an is the source of guidance, mercy, illumination and healing for the faithful at all times, and as such, gathering for the Qur’an is a richly rewarded act of devotion.The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “When people gather on the Qur’an to read and study it, the angels will descend upon them, and Allah’s mercy will engulf them.” He also said, “Read the Qur’an so long as your hearts are united on understanding it. … When you start dissenting, rise up and disperse.” (Muslim)2- We are also ordered and encouraged to befriend and accompany people who are pious and knowledgeable. This is because we stand to gain spiritually by being with those who are pious and knowledgeable.The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “A person follows the way of his friend or the company he keeps; therefore let everyone know who he is keeping as a friend or companion.” (Abu Dawud)Based on this and similar traditions, scholars have said that it is important to keep company of the pious and knowledgeable as much as possible.If, therefore, people gather in the presence of a pious or knowledgeable person in order to benefit from his/her piety and knowledge, then it is indeed a spiritually rewarding act.Imam Al-Ghazzali explains this point by pointing out that a person’s character is deeply influenced by those he/she keeps as friends and companions.3- As for the issue of offering du`aa’ for the deceased, we are exhorted in the Qur’an and the Sunnah to pray for those who have passed away: “And those who came after them say: “Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who were before us in the faith, and do not place in our hearts any rancor toward those who believe. Our Lord! You are Kind, Compassionate” (Al-Hashr 59:10)We also read in the Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) told us that one of the duties we owe towards our parents after their death is, “to praying for them and invoke Allah’s mercy on them.”4- Coming to the precedent of reading the Qur’an and making a du`aa’ afterwards, there are precedents for it in the practice of the righteous predecessors, as we know some of them used to gather their family members in reading the Qur’an after which they used to offer collective supplications.The Qur’an being the word of Allah, it is perfectly all right to invoke Allah’s mercy after reading the same. Therefore, it cannot be considered as an innovation.5- In light of the above, if they are calling a pious or knowledgeable person in order to be inspired, spiritually and morally, then that is indeed a highly desirable thing to do; there cannot be anything un-Islamic about it; rather it is perfectly Islamic and edifying to do.If, on the other hand, people have the wrong belief that this person is an intermediary before Allah and that they approach him through him then that is akin to shirk (associating other partners with Allah); it must therefore be shunned and opposed. But I don’t think that that is the case with people calling a scholar or a hafizh (memorizer of the Qur’an) to preside over their functions.We must not rush to call each and every thing as shirk or bid`ah. In this way, we will be choking our religious life, and Islam thus will be reduced to a set of traffic symbols of “stop” and “go.”6- Finally, when people gather there is nothing wrong with their eating together, for the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged us to eat together as there is greater barakah(blessing) in doing so. Therefore, I see no reason to condemn it unless it involves the practice of offering food to the deceased or saints, etc. which can undoubtedly be described as practices tainted with shirk.In conclusion, collective reading of the Qur’an and offering du`aa’ following the same is a noble act; to invite knowledgeable people to preside over such functions is also a noble act so long one does not make a permanent ritual out of it, thus considering it as an integral practice of religion that must be enforced.Since we stand to benefit spiritually and morally from accompanying and gathering around those who are pious and knowledgeable, it cannot be considered to be tainted with shirk as long as one does not have the intention of taking them as intermediaries before Allah.When pronouncing judgment on such matters, it is always important to keep in mind the Prophetic dictum, “Actions are reckoned by intentions; everyone is rewarded according to his intentions.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Allah Almighty knows best.Excerpted, with slight modifications, from: www.islam.ca"

Wearing Black Clothes for Mourning the Dead: A Must?								Wa`alykum As-Salaamu Warahmatullahi Wabarakaatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother in Islam, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake.First of all, it is be noted that Islam demands its adherents to show patience and acceptance of Allah’s will when they face the calamity of the death of a relative. Therefore, it forbade them from all acts and sayings that show discontent and dissatisfaction with Allah’s verdict such as wailing, tearing clothes, etc.The eyes of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) shed tears for the death of his son, Ibrahim, and he said: “O Ibrahim, our eyes shed tears and our hearts are filled with grief, but we do not say anything except that by which Allah is pleased. O Ibrahim, we are grieved for you.”As regards your question, the late Sheikh Hassanain Makhluf, former Mufti of Egypt, states the following:Every Muslim and Muslimah should receive the death (of a relative or an associate) patiently showing their acceptance of Allah’s verdict. The maximum period of mourning for a woman is four months and ten days, if the deceased is her husband, and three days for relatives and other persons. It is impermissible for a woman to exceed these periods for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “It is not legal for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for any dead person except her husband, for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.”Mourning is done by avoiding ornaments and perfumes, etc. not by crying, wailing, slapping the cheeks, shaving hair, and other forbidden acts. Wearing black clothes as a sign of mourning is only permissible within the period of mourning.”Elaborating on the concept of mourning from an Islamic point of view and its limitation, we would like to quote the following:Different societies have different customs and traditions associated with death in the family. In non-Islamic societies, there are visible signs of mourning which are supposed to convey grief. People, especially women, should wear black for a certain period, according to the degree of their relation with the deceased. Men may wear a black tie, etc. In certain communities, death is marked by loud crying and tearing of clothes, etc. All this is forbidden in Islam. This does not preclude that people may grieve for their deceased and they may express their grief with shedding tears. This sort of crying must not be accompanied by wailing. That is un-Islamic.The maximum period of mourning for a woman is three days, if the deceased is a very close relation to her, but not her husband. In other words, mourning for a deceased father, son or brother may be only over a period of three days, after that, she must show her acceptance of Allah’s verdict. We have a report of two cases of the Prophet’s wives, Um Habiba and Zaynab. The first lost her father, Abu Sufyan, and the other lost her brother.After three days, in each case, each of them requested perfume to wear. Both of them said that they had no desire whatsoever to wear perfume, but they had heard the Prophet saying: “It is not legal for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days for any dead person except her husband, for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.” As you realize, this is the length of the waiting period of a widow. During her waiting period, she must not wear make-up.The above quotation is excerpted with slight modifications from www.islamicity.comAllah Almighty knows best. "

May Allah reward you abundantly for your interest in knowing the teachings of Islam!As for your query, one sheep is sufficient only for a man and his family while a cow or a camel is sufficient for one to seven families.Responding to your question, Sheikh M. S. Al-Munajjid, a prominent Saudi Muslim lecturer and author, states,One sheep is sufficient as a sacrificial animal for one man and his family and whoever he wants among the Muslims, based on the Hadith of `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered that a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) round the eyes should be brought to him so that he could sacrifice it.He said to `A’ishah, “Give me the knife,” and she did that. He took it, then he took the ram, placed it on the ground and then slaughtered it (i.e., prepared to slaughter it), saying, “In the name of Allah, O Allah, accept (this sacrifice) on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and the Ummah of Muhammad.” Then he sacrificed it. (Muslim)It was narrated that Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and his household, and they would eat some and give some to others (Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi)If a man sacrifices a single sheep or goat on behalf of himself and his family, that will suffice for everyone he intended of his family, whether living or deceased. If he did not intend anything specific, then it includes all those who are included in this word (family or household), either customarily or linguistically.Customarily it refers to all those whom he supports of wives, children, and relatives; linguistically it includes all those who are related to him of his own children and the descendants of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.One-seventh of a camel or a cow is equivalent to one sheep. If a man sacrifices one-seventh of a camel or cow on behalf of himself and his family, that is sufficient because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said that one-seventh of a camel or a cow takes the place of one sheep in the case of the hadi (sacrifice offered during Hajj), so that applies also to the Udhiyah because there is no difference between the Udhiyah  and the hadi in this regard.If two or more people buy one sheep and sacrifice it, it is not sufficient, because no such thing has been narrated in the Qur’an or the Sunnah. Similarly, if eight or more people share one camel or one cow, that is not sufficient (but it is permissible for seven people to share a camel or a cow), because acts of worship are as prescribed in the Qur’an and Sunnah and are not subject to personal opinion; it is not permissible to go beyond the set limits with regard to how much is to be done or the way in which it is to be done.This does not have to do with including others in the reward because it was narrated that there is no limit to the number of people on whose behalf the sacrifice may be offered.Allah Almighty knows best.Excerpted, with slight modifications from, islamqa.info"

What is “Taqwa” and How Can I Develop It?								

 

The Teachers Are Trying to Ruin Us								Wa `alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Thank you for your good question and concern about your fellow Muslims.Sacrificing an animal for Allah’s sake in udhiyyah is a form of showing thanks and gratitude to Allah Almighty, who created us, and gave us life and many blessings. Animals are created by Allah Almighty for certain purposes, among which is to be mercifully slaughtered by humans for food and other acceptable benefits.Responding to your question, Imam Dr. Wael Shihab, PhD in Islamic Studies from Al-Azhar University, and currently the Imam of the Downtown Toronto Masjid in Canada, sates,Udhiyyah, a sacrificial animal that is slaughtered in worship of Allah on the day of `Eid Al-Adha, is a confirmed Sunnah according to the majority of Muslim jurists. Abu Hanifah and other scholars regard it as obligatory. A Muslim who is financially able to afford it is highly encouraged to offer it to feed the poor, his family and relatives, and his own self. Only camels, cattle, sheep, or goats may be slaughtered. At the youngest, camels must be over five full years of age, cattle and goats over two full years, and sheep over one full year.A single camel or cow fulfills the Sunnah for seven men and their families, though a goat or a sheep only fulfills it for one. It is recommended that a third of the animal sacrificed be eaten, a third be gifted to relatives and friends, and a third be given as charity. (See The Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence, vol. 5, pp 74-107)Legality and merits of the udhiyyah are evidenced by the Qur’an and the Sunnah. For instance, Allah Almighty says in the Qur’an, (Pray unto they Lord, and sacrifice) (Al-Kawthar 108:2)This verse means a Muslim should pray `Eid Al-Adha and then sacrifice his udhiyyah for Allah’s sake. Al-Bara’ reported, “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) delivering a khutbah (sermon) saying, “The first thing to be done on this (`Eid Al-Adha) day is to pray; and after returning from the prayer we slaughter our sacrifices (in the name of Allah) and whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunnah.’” (Al-Bukhari)Historically, udhiyyah has been legislated, as a Sunnah, in the second year after Hijrah, the same year in which `Eid Prayers and zakah were prescribed.Udhiyyah, in fact, is meant to show gratitude and thankfulness to Allah for His countless blessings and favors. Also, it helps in feeding the poor, the needy, and one’s family and relatives. So, it has religious, social, and economical fruits.Moreover, udhiyyah revives the Sunnah of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when Allah Almighty commanded him to slaughter an animal in ransom for his child, Isma`il (peace be upon him) on the day of Nahr (the day of `Eid Al-Adha). So, udhiyyah is traced back to Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him), not a Hindu tradition as the question states.It is noteworthy that Allah Almighty created people, animals, birds, and everything in the world; He, Most High, created animals for people’s benefits and allowed merciful and kind slaughtering of animals for food.He, Almighty, says, (And the cattle has He created, whence you have warm clothing and uses, and whereof you eat. And wherein is beauty for you, when you bring them home, and when you take them out to pasture. And they bear your loads for you unto a land you could not reach save with great trouble to yourselves. Lo! Your Lord is Full of Pity, Merciful.) (An-Nahl 16: 5-7)Given the above, it becomes evident that udhiyyah is a Sunnah that was first practiced by Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) at the command of Allah. It has significant religious, social, and economic objectives.May Allah Almighty strengthen your faith and ours and guide us all to what is best in this world and the world to come.Allah Almighty knows best."

Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:If someone gives you a gift, and you are not sure whether his money is all halal or haram, then you are allowed to accept his gift without questioning.In his response to the question in point, the prominent Muslim scholar, Sheikh Muhammad Iqbal Nadvi, Imam of Calgary Mosque, Alberta, Canada, and Former Professor at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, states,This question entails a couple of points that we have to clarify as follows:1- If you are not sure from the beginning that a person’s money is halal (lawful) or haram (unlawful) wholeheartedly, then you are not supposed to dig deep in the matter in order to get accurate information for something that you don’t need to. So, if someone gives you a gift, and you are not sure whether his money is all halal or haram, then you are allowed to accept his gift without questioning.2- If someone has money that is mixed from haram and halal sources, but the halal source is more, then the money of this person is halal in general, but he has shubha (doubt) in his money.In this case, we are still allowed to accept the gift as part of the halal source, unless you are making dawah to this person and you think that by refraining from accepting his gift he would give up the haram thing and repent to Allah.3- The third case, which should be clarified here, is that not all bank transactions are haram. Even in riba-bank transactions, the riba does not get in all dealings. So, a person who works for the bank has halal and haram money in his salary. If this is the case, then you are not allowed to generalize the ruling and render the whole money of that person as haram. You can still accept his gift.In conclusion, we’d like to state that you can approach this person and advise him gently and kindly if he is involved directly in the forbidden activity of giving riba-based loans.In his response to your question, Prof. Dr. Monzer Kahf, Professor of Islamic Finance and Economics at Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, states:It is permissible to work in any department in a conventional bank, credit department or others, as long as you do not prepare any interest-based contracts or sign them on behalf of the bank.This is the opinion of the greatest Shari`ah scholar of our time, the late Sheikh Mostafa Al-Zarqa (died 1999), Sheikh As-Salami of Tunisia and Sheikh Al-Dhareer of Sudan. The argument is that such jobs in conventional banks are not included in the wrath of Allah that is mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on the giver of riba, its taker, its writer and its two witnesses (Reported by Muslim).Besides, a prohibition of working in banks places unnecessary inconvenience and hardship on Muslims both in the Muslim majority countries and Muslim communities of other countries.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

House Rent and Land for Selling: Subject to Zakah?								Wa `alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Brother, thank you for your good question and concern about your rights.Islam calls for justice and forbids all forms of oppression. One should defend his rights by all possible legal means. The community should help the oppressed regain his rights. The oppressor should repent and return back people’s rights; otherwise Allah’s anger and punishment will befall him.Responding to your question, Dr. Wael Shihab, PhD  in Islamic Studies from Al-Azhar University, and currently the Imam of the Downtown Toronto Masjid in Canada, states:In fact, Islam explicitly forbids all forms of oppression. Injustice and oppression cannot be justified under any pretext. So, a Muslim should steer clear of all forms of oppression.Jabir Ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) as saying: “Be on your guard against committing oppression, for oppression is a darkness on the Day of Resurrection…” (Muslim)On the authority of Abu Dharr Al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that among the sayings he relates from his Lord (may He be glorified) is that He said: “O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.” (Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah)Injustice may be exercised by stealing or usurping people’s property, offending and insulting them, or by violating and overbearing the weak persons.Allah Almighty says, “The blame is only against those who oppress men with wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice: for such there will be a chastisement grievous.” (Ash-Shura 42:42)Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever usurps even one span of the land of somebody, his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection.” (Muslim)A person who wrongs or usurps others’ properties should repent to Allah before it’s too late. He should return back people’s rights, feel remorse for his sins, stop his wrongdoings, and resolve not to commit such sins again. These are the conditions of true and sincere repentance. If an oppressor fails to meet these conditions, he will definitely expose himself to Allah’s anger and severe punishment.As for the oppressed person, he should resort to all legal channels and authorities to get his rights back. He should defend and regain his rights by all possible available means. The community should help him regain his usurped rights.Allah Almighty knows best."

Is There Blessing in Time?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. Dear brother in Islam, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake.With regard to your question, Dr. `Abdel-Fattaah Idrees, professor of Comparative Jurisprudence at Al-Azhar University, states: Institutions, academic or whatever, award prizes to whoever provides the best answer or solution to a given problem or issue. Such awards must not be considered as a price for the benefit accrued from the prize-giving party. Rather, the aim is to reward those who worked hard with efforts that speak on their behalf. Prizes are awarded to motivate and encourage others to produce work that is for the progress of society.The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was the foremost in staging competition between his Companions. He did so by asking to answer questions. `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Among trees there is one whose leaves never fall; it typifies a true Muslim (in sticking to the noble values of Islam). Can any one of you tell me what it is?” This question put the people off balance, and they all said it was a tree in the desert. I (`Abdullah ibn `Umar) thought it was a palm tree, but I felt too shy to say so (in the presence of notable Companions like Abu Bakr and `Umar). Failing to answer it, the people said, “Tell us what is it, O Prophet.” He said, “It is palm tree.”According to the majority of scholars, what makes it permissible to compete to find the correct or best answer for any given question, academic or non-academic, is the noble cause on which it is based.So, by and large, it is quite clear that such competition is permissible in an Islamic perspective on the condition that no prize is awarded. This is according to the views of the majority of scholars.However, the Hanafi School maintains that awarding prizes is permissible, because they will act as a stimulus and incentive for others to work harder.Based on this latter view, it is permissible in Islam for state institutions to award prizes for the best performance, as this will encourage people to put more effort into developing their career and will ultimately lead to the progress of the whole community.Almighty Allah knows best."

My Daughter, a Witness to Violence								Wa `alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother, we commend your eagerness to become well acquainted with Islam and its teachings and also your eagerness to keep your children stick to Islam’s teachings.It is the duty of parents to raise their children upon the teachings of Islam by using all possible good means. In fact, the Internet can help parents in this regard if it is used correctly. However, parents should guide their children to the ways of using it in a positive way and protect them against misusing this service.In response to your question, the prominent Muslim scholar, Sheikh Muhammad Iqbal Nadvi, Imam of Calgary Mosque, Alberta, Canada, and Former Professor at King Saud University, Riyad, Saudi Arabia, states,There are many ways of protecting both children and ourselves from the haram (unlawful) as follows:1- By creating a barrier between us and sins.2- By providing alternatives to take us away from the haram.Applying this to your situation, you need to establish firm and healthy channels of communication with your children and explain to them the Islamic position concerning these issues and how to deal with them. The best way to achieve this is to be a good role model for your children, for if they see you as a good example, they will learn the good from you as well.You are supposed to introduce alternatives to them. There are many good Islamic websites that they can visit and learn from. They can be given tasks to do on each website, and then can receive prizes for that.Most importantly we must teach our kids how to choose the right friends, who are aware of Islamic teachings and can protect them from learning about haram.The following are some a Qur’anic verses and hadiths:1- Surat An-Nur 24:30-312- Surat An-Nur 24:193- Surat An-Nur 24:214- Surat An-Nur 24:27, about the manners of family life.5- Surat An-Nur 24:58-59Hadiths:1- “The eye does commit zina (adultery or fornication) and its zina is the lustful look..”(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)2- “A man must not look at the `awrah (parts to be covered) of [another] man and a woman must not look at the `awrah of [another] woman; and they shall not share the same blanket when sleeping in the same bed.” (Muslim)Allah Almighty knows best."

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Allah has permitted for us all that is good and wholesome and prohibited all that is impure and unwholesome.2- It is a fact that Muslims are not allowed to consume pork or it’s by-products or animals that are not slaughtered or animals immolated to idols or deities other than God.3- Scholar cannot declare soaps or detergents which may contain lard or oil or flesh of swine as forbidden for Muslims to use. If we were allowed to say that, then the same could be said of vinegar made from wine or alcohol.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and an Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states,The Prophet (peace be upon him) also taught us not to be rigid and extend the prohibitions beyond the limits.  Ibn Masud said: “You may do well to emulate the Prophet’s companions who never acted rigidly in matters of halal and haram.” Thus, when they ventured out of Arabia, they used to partake of the foods of the people of the book without digging into the details regarding their method of slaughter. They also used to eat cheese and other dairy products of Persians upon entering Persia, even though they were mostly Zoroastrians and not Jews or Christians.They took to heart the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “God has laid down certain obligatory duties, so never be slack in fulfilling them, and He has forbidden certain things so abstain from them. He has set certain limits, so never transgress them, and He is silent of many things, so do not dig into them; for He did so out of mercy for you and not because He is forgetful; then the Prophet cited the verse: Your Lord is never forgetful.” (Ad-Daraqutni)Therefore, the scholars and jurists were never hasty in declaring things as haram. They used to abide by such rules: Permission is the rule while prohibition is an exception; hardship brings ease.Now coming to consuming pork and its by-products there is no question we are to abstain from them; it is the same with alcohol or wine or intoxicants.However, the question arises when wine or alcohol or by-products of pork such as its fat or oil used in certain products. The scholars would ask whether these ingredients retain the original properties or are wholly changed chemically into another product: if there is no change, the rule is clearly prohibition.If, however, there is a chemical change in such a way that it does not retain the original properties, then the answer is: it is permissible. An example is that of wine or alcohol transformed into vinegar. The former is forbidden while vinegar is permissible.Therefore, the jurists established the following rule: That a thing that is otherwise impure or forbidden can become pure or lawful once it is changed chemically through the law of istihalah. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim explains this as follows:“That wine is rendered pure through the process of (chemical) transformation (istihalah) is known by analogy. For, though wine is impure, once the factor responsible for its impurity is taken away, the rule changes. It is a well-established principle of the Shar`iah based on fundamental sources. And it is the basis for reward and punishment.”Accordingly, the same rule extends to things – previously deemed as impure-  once chemically transformed, they become pure and lawful for our use.Hence the texts declaring carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, wine or alcohol as haram cannot extend to plants, fruits, ashes, salt, mud, and vinegar: neither literally nor in meaning; neither by textual evidence nor through analogy.So, when they say; wine became impure through chemical change (it was originally grapes or dates, etc.); likewise it becomes pure through chemical change when turned into vinegar. The same should apply to all things that were originally impure if they have undergone a chemical change.”Based on these principles, Islamic medical association conference held in Kuwait on May 24, 1995, came up with the following conclusion:Chemical transformation which results in turning a particular substance into different products with wholly different attributes and properties makes the impure as pure and lawful.Therefore, soap containing lard or oil or pigments extracted from pork or other dead animals becomes pure because of the chemical transformation involved.In conclusion, I would like to state: We cannot declare soaps or detergents which may contain lard or oil or flesh of swine as forbidden for Muslims to use. If we were allowed to say that, then the same could be said of vinegar made from wine or alcohol.Having said this, I would like to point out: If someone wants to avoid soaps made of animal sources and stick to plant-based ones, that is their personal discretion; it is one thing to prefer something for personal reasons, and it is another to declare something that is lawful as unlawful.The latter is a grave sin akin to ascribing partners with Allah – in the words of Imam Ibn al-Qayyim for we are not allowed to attribute the rule of halal and haram based on our opinions.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

Dear brother in Islam, thank you for your question which reflects your care to have a clear view of the teachings of Islam. Allah commands Muslims to refer to people of knowledge to get themselves well-acquainted with the teachings of Islam as well as all aspects of life.
The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) perfectly epitomized the Qur’anic guidance, and he won the love and admiration of his Companions so that every one of his words, acts, or even tacit approval was precisely recorded and transmitted to the following generations of the Muslim Ummah.Aside from the acts that were done out of his human nature, Muslim jurists have regarded the acts of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) as part of his Sunnah that ought to be followed and on which legislation is to be based.Answering this question, Sheikh M. S. Al-Munajjid, a prominent Saudi Muslim lecturer and author, said: First, it should be noted that the basic principle concerning the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is that they constitute legislation for the Ummah, and it is not permissible to say that it is only for the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) unless there is clear evidence to indicate that, because Almighty Allah says: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example to follow.” (Al-Ahzab 33:21)Based on this principle, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) followed the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in what he did, and they did not ask him whether this action was only for him or not. One of the reports which indicate this was narrated from Abu Sa`id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) was in salah and then he took off his shoes, so the people took off their shoes. When he finished he said: “Why did you take off your shoes?” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, we saw you take off your shoes, so we took off ours.” He said: “Gabriel came to me and told me that there was some impurity on them. When one of you comes to the mosque, let him turn up his shoe and look at it, and if he sees something dirty on it let him wipe it on the ground, then let him pray wearing them. ” (Ahmad)Indeed, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) got angry with some of his Companions when they thought that an action he had done was something that was exclusively for him.It was narrated from `A’ishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), that a man said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, sometimes I wake up junub (having major ritual impurity) and I want to fast.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Sometimes I wake up junub and I want to fast, so I perform ghusl and fast.” The man said: “O Messenger of Allah, you are not like us; Allah has forgiven your previous and future sins.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) got angry, and said: “By Allah, I hope to be the one who fears Allah most among you and the most knowledgeable of what I follow.” (Abu Dawud)Ibn Hazm commented:“It is not permissible to say that anything the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did was exclusively for him, unless there is a text to that effect. This is because he got angry with the one who said that, and everything which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got angry about is haram.”Ibn al-Qayyim pointed out:“The basic principle is that his Ummah share the same rulings with him except in cases where there is evidence that a ruling applies exclusively to him.”Second, among the rulings that applied exclusively to him (peace and blessings be upon him) were: marriage without a mahr or wali; marriage to more than four women at the same time; and fasting continually for more than one day.
Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:It is not permissible for anyone after this to say concerning anything that the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) did that it was exclusively for him, except on the basis of a text, such as that which speaks of the woman who offered herself to him in marriage, “…a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers” (Al-Ahzab 33:50); or his fasting continually and forbidding them to do that, saying “I am not like you”; or his sleeping and praying without renewing his wudu’ and when he was asked about that, he said, “My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep.”Almighty Allah knows best.Excerpted with modification and editing from www.islamqa.info"

How Can Youth Avoid Summer Temptations?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Islam is the religion of chastity and modesty. It blocks all means leading to sin and evil. It commands a Muslim to keep himself away from what makes him subject to Allah’s wrath and gets him closer to Satan’s traps.2- In one of his hadiths, the Prophet (peace be upon him) states: “Let not a man and a woman be together with no mahram (unmarriageable relative) lest Satan accompanies them i.e. leading them to sin.”Coming to the question in point, the late Sheikh Muhammad Al-Bahyy, ex-dean of the Faculty of Theology at Al-Azhar University (may Allah have mercy on his soul) states:Mixed trips that involve males and females grouped together are not totally rejected. However, we need to make it clear that if such trips and camps involve young ones who have not yet reached the age of puberty, they are permissible and fruitful especially when they aim at increasing mutual respect between the two sexes.However, when such camps are attended by teenagers and of vigorous youth, the so-called “mutual understanding between both sexes” may lead to a form of sexual deviation and unlawful relations, a thing which will affect not only those young people but their families and the whole society as well.The Qur’anic guidance directed to the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and to all Muslim women, clearly calls for keeping away from illegal mixing between men and women in order to avoid the harmful consequences.Allah Almighty says:“O you wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire (to you), but utter customary speech.” (Al-Ahzab 33:32)Stressing the fact that preventing such unwanted mixing is better than curing its bad consequences for prevention is better than cure, Allah Almighty says:“And stay in your houses. Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the Time of ignorance.” (Al-Ahzab 33:33)The verse clearly shows that Muslim women are not to show their attractions that make them subject to persons in whose bosoms there is disease (who are morally corrupt).It is also clear that a woman is permitted to go out of her house if there is a valid reason to do so, that is, to fulfill a need while adhering to her modesty and abiding by chastity.Moreover,  Dr. `Abdul `Azeem Ad-Deeb, the late Professor of Shari`ah at the University of Qatar, states:A true and committed Muslim who fears Allah should never participate in any activity, i.e. camps, trips, or journeys involving nudity and unlawful mixing between men and women.He must always remember the Day in which he will stand before his Lord Who will question him about such gathering.

Fasting in Rajab and Shaban: What Are the Virtues?								

 

How Do I Rectify a Broken Promise to Fast Rajab, Shaban and Ramadan?								

 

Are the Blessings of Rajab and Shaban Authentic?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa: Many of the hadiths reported about the worth and merit of Rajab are either weak or fabricated. However, we should remember that there are many important events in Islamic history that took place in the month of Rajab, such as the Night Journey and Ascension (Israa’ and Mi`raj) according to some views, the Battle of Tabuk, and the liberation of Al-Aqsa Mosque from the crusaders at the hands of Salah Ad-Din Al-Ayyubi. Muslims should recall these great victories and derive lessons from them.Answering your question, Sheikh `Atiyyah Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, states:There are some months as well as some places that have more worth in Almighty Allah’s sight than others. But the merit of a certain place or time in Islam is established only through authentic proofs. Hence, on quoting a certain hadith, one is to make sure of its authenticity so that no false hadiths are reported to have been said by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).Al-Hafizh Ibn Hajar Al-`Asqalani, an eminent scholar, wrote a detailed study entitled “Tabyeen Al-`Ajab bima Warada fi Fadl Rajab.” Ibn Hajar included in this study almost all the hadiths reported about the merit of Rajab and the rewards entailed by observing fasting and optional Prayer during it, classifying these hadiths into either weak or fabricated ones.He also mentioned that Rajab has eighteen names, the most famous of which are these: Al-Asamm (“the Deaf Month”). It was called so because no rattle of weapons was heard during it, it being one of the sacred months in which fighting is prohibited. It was called also Al-Asabb (“the Poured-in Month”), because [it was believed that] mercy is poured on people during it. It was called also “the Iron Remover.” In this regard it was reported that Abu Raja’ Al-`Utaridi said, “We used to worship stones [before Islam].But when we found a better stone than the first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter. If we could not get a stone then we would collect some earth (soil), then bring a sheep and milk that sheep over it, and perform Tawaf around it. When the month of Rajab came, we used (to stop the military actions), calling this month the Iron Remover, for we used to remove and throw away the iron parts of every spear and arrow during it” (Al-Bukhari)The merit of Rajab is like the merit of the rest of the other sacred months. Allah Almighty says: (Lo! the number of the months with Allah is twelve months by Allah’s ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are sacred: that is the right religion. So wrong not yourselves in them) (At-Tawbah 9:36)The names of these sacred months are mentioned in an authentic hadith said by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in the Farewell Pilgrimage. According to this hadith, the sacred months are four, three in succession—that is, Dhul-Qi`dah, Dhul-Hijjah, and Muharram—and the fourth is Rajab, which comes between Jumada Thani and Sha`ban.According to the above verse, Allah Almighty has ordered the Muslims not to wrong themselves (or others), especially in these sacred months. So no fighting between tribes was to be waged during these months, so that people would guarantee that the way to the Sacred House be safe. This is indicated by Almighty Allah’s saying in another verse: “Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them” (At-Tawbah 9:5)Another manifestation of not wronging oneself in the sacred months is to avoid committing sins or wronging others. Some scholars derived from Almighty Allah’s ordering Muslims not to wrong themselves especially in the sacred months that the blood money paid in the case of killing a person by mistake is to be increased by one third if this act is committed during the sacred months. But it is to be noted that the fatwas of those scholars are not based on direct evidence from the Qur’an or Sunnah.Observing voluntary fasting in the sacred months, including Rajab, is recommended. In this regard, Abu Dawud reported on the authority of Mujibah Al-Bahilyyah that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to her father or uncle, “Observe fasting for some days in the sacred months and leave fasting for other days.” He (peace and blessings be upon him) said this three times, folding three fingers of him and then unfolding them each time. The Prophet’s using three fingers here is meant to assert his recommendation of fasting during these months, and not to indicate the number of the days to observe fasting therein.Hence, doing good deeds, including fasting, in Rajab is generally praiseworthy like doing so in the rest of the sacred months. According to Ibn Hajar, there is no hadith, whether authentic or good, reported to the effect that observing fasting in Rajab entails a special reward.Among the weak hadiths circulated about the special rewards entailed by fasting in Rajab is this: “There is a river in Paradise called Rajab; its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. He who observes fasting of a day from the month of Rajab is like him who observes fasting for a whole month; he who observes fasting of seven days from it will be given refuge against the seven gates of the Fire; he who observes fasting of eight days from it, the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him; and he who observes fasting of ten days from it, his bad deeds will be turned into good ones.”There is another long hadith reported in this regard, in the context of which it is reported, “Rajab is Almighty Allah’s month, Sha`ban is my month, and Ramadan is my Ummah’s month.” This hadith was said to be fabricated. It was also mentioned in Al-Jami` Al-Kabir by As-Suyuti that this hadith was reported by Abu Al-Fath ibn Abu Al-Fawaris in his book Amali as a mursal hadith (a hadith which a Successor has directly attributed to the Prophet without mentioning a Companion).Of the fabricated hadiths reported about the praise worthiness of offering special Prayers during Rajab is this: “He who performs the Maghrib Prayer in the first night of Rajab, and then offers twenty rak`ahs, two by two, reciting in each rak`ah surat Al-Fatihah and surat “Qul huwa Allahu Ahad,” Allah Almighty will guard him, his family, his wealth, his children; he will also be given refuge against the punishment of the grave and will pass over the bridge above Hell like lightening without being brought to account or exposed to punishment (in the Hereafter).”Ibn Hajar dedicated in the study referred to above, a whole chapter for the hadiths reported about prohibiting fasting the whole month of Rajab. He then said, “This prohibition applies to the person who observes fasting during it out of following the pre-Islamic tradition of sanctifying this month.But if he observes fasting in this month for Allah’s sake without obligating himself to fast certain days from it, or to offer night vigil Prayer in certain nights of it, there is nothing wrong in this. The prohibition meant here is analogous to the prohibition referred to in the Prophet’s hadith ‘Do not single out the night (preceding) Friday among the nights for Prayer and do not single out Friday among days for fasting.’” (Muslim)As for him who observes fasting in Rajab, believing that fasting during it is more praiseworthy than fasting in the other months, this is controversial among scholars, but Ibn Hajar was of the opinion that this is not permissible.Ibn Hajar also quoted Abu Bakr At-Tartushi as saying in Al-Bida` wa Al-Hawadith, “It is not recommended to observe fasting in Rajab if this is done out of one of three intentions, one of which is to do so out of believing that its fasting is obligatory like the fasting of Ramadan, or it is a regular act of Sunnah, or that its fasting is more rewarded and praiseworthy than fasting in the other months. If anything of the kind had been true, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would have clarified it. According to Ibn Dihyah, fasting in general is a good act, but it should not be observed in Rajab out of believing that it entails special rewards then. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would not recommend fasting in Rajab out of this belief.”Concerning visiting graves in Rajab, many people, especially women, are used to visiting graves on the first Friday of Rajab. There is nothing in Shari`ah that recommends such an act, and doing so does not entail a reward better than that entailed by visiting graves on any other ordinary day.Muslims should, rather, remember the important events that took place in the history of Islam during this month, such as the Night Journey and Ascension, the Battle of Tabuk, and the liberation of Al-Aqsa Mosque from the crusaders at the hands of Salah Ad-Din Al-Ayubi (AH 538). Muslims should derive lessons from this glorious history, so that they may reunite and seek to liberate Al-Aqsa Mosque anew from its recent brutal occupiers.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Using dry hair brushes would not make one’s hair filthy, for the coming into contact with dry pig-hair does not transfer the filth to one’s body.2- The prayers you performed after using a dry hair brush made of boar bristles would not have to be repeated.3- If one’s hair or body comes into contact with a wet boar bristles brush, then one should wash one’s hair and repeat the prayer.In his answer to your question, Mufti Muhammad Ibn Adam Al-Kawthari, Director and researcher at the Institute of Islamic Jurisprudence (Darul Iftaa, www.daruliftaa.com), Member of the Al-Qalam Shari`ah Scholars Panel, and advisor on Islamic Banking, states:A pig is considered to be essentially filthy, hence the position of the Hanafi School and that of many other imams, is that the skin, hair, and all other components of the pig remains filthy even after the tanning process is carried out.Imam Ibn `Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) explains:“(Al-Haskafi’s statement: “Pigskin cannot be purified”) this is due to the fact that a pig is considered essentially filthy, in that the essence of a pig with all its body-components is filthy, whether dead or alive. Hence, the filthiness is not because of the blood that is contained in its body like other non-pure animals. Therefore, it does not accept purification (by tanning or other such methods)….” (Radd al-Muhtar, 1/204)Imam Al-Haskafi (Allah have mercy on him) states specifically with regard to pig-hair:“The hair of a dead animal other than a pig…….is pure”Imam Ibn `Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) explains:“According to Imam Abu Yusuf, which is the established narration in the Hanafi School, the hair of a pig is considered filthy and impure. This is the position chosen by Imam Al-Kasani in his Al-Bada’i` and Imam Al-Mawsili in his Al-Ikhtiyar.Thus, if one prayed with pig-hair more than the amount of a dirham, one’s prayer would not be valid…” (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 1/206)In light of the above, it will not be permitted to acquire and use a hair brush that is made of boar bristles.If one is relatively certain of the hair brush being predominantly made of pig-hair, then one must avoid using the brush.If one offers prayer with pig-hair (or any other part of a pig’s body) attached to one’s self or clothing, then one would have to repeat one’s prayer.However, using dry hair brushes would not make one’s hair filthy, for the coming into contact with dry pig-hair does not transfer the filth to one’s body.Thus, the prayers you performed after using a dry hair brush made of boar bristles would not have to be repeated.However, if one’s hair or body comes into contact with a wet boar bristles brush, then one should wash one’s hair and repeat the prayer.Almighty Allah knows best."

Also keep the thought of Allah always in your mind and make dhikr(remembrance of Allah) your second nature by repeating words such as “subhanAllah; al-hamdu lillah; la ilaha illa Allah; wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah” (glory to Allah; praise be to Allah; there is no god but Allah; there is no power or strength except by the will of Allah).6. Finally, ask Allah to keep your heart and mind steadfast on faith by reading the following:Allahumma ya muqalliba al-qulub thabbit qalbi `ala deenika (O Allah, You are the twister and turner of the hearts; so make my heart firm on Your religion).Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

You will not be relieved of the responsibility until you pay it, so do that promptly, and may Allah bless you.As for paying Zakah on permissible adornment, this is a point of disagreement among the scholars. The opinion that it must be paid is more certain to clear you of your obligation and more cautious in terms of your faith.So, if the amount of gold has reached the legal threshold (nisab), which is 85 grams, you have to pay the Zakah for it, for that is better in terms of meeting your obligation and more pleasing to your Allah.We ask Allah to grant success to us and to you.

Stoning Pillars During Hajj: Did Devils Turn into Stone?								In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:There is nothing wrong with wearing a sling to carry a baby during the state of ihram, for such an act resembles carrying a waterskin or a purse, which is not forbidden.Responding to the question, the prominent Saudi Islamic lecturer and author Sheikh Muhammad Saleh Al-Munajjid states:There is nothing wrong with wearing a sling to carry a baby while in the state of ihram, because that is not the kind of clothing that is described in the texts as being forbidden during the state of ihram, nor is it like such clothing.It is rather more like carrying a waterskin or a purse, or like carrying one’s luggage on one’s back tied with a rope around the chest, which is not forbidden.The clothes that are forbidden [for men] during the state of ihram are shirts, pants, burnus (a wide garment with an attached hood to cover the head), turbans, and khifaf (pl. of khuff socks made from thick fabric or leather). The evidence for such forbiddance is the hadith reported by `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): A man stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allah, what do you command us to wear when we enter the state of ihram?” He said, “Do not wear a shirt, pants, a turban, a burnus or khifaf, unless a man does not have any sandals, in which case he may wear khifaf and cut them so that they reach below the ankle. And do not wear any garment that has been dyed with saffron or wars (safflower).”With the above in mind, we consider the sling mentioned in the question like carrying a waterskin or carrying one’s luggage on the back tied with a rope around the chest when necessary. Some scholars state that it is permissible for a person in the state of ihram to carry his luggage on his back and to tie it with a rope around the chest when necessary. This is very much like a sling for carrying a child.Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date.Source: www.islamqa.info."

A man named Uqbah once came to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and notified him that he had just learned that his wife was also his sister through breastfeeding. When the man tried to convince the Prophet to let them remain married he responded, “How can you keep her when that lady has said that she has suckled you both of you? So abandon (divorce) her.” (Al-Bukhari and At-Tirmidhi)If this is the case for a milk-sister, then being married to a real sister is even more detested. The two of them must separate. They will not be held accountable in front of Allah for what they did without having knowledge.Almighty Allah knows best."

Is that true?,"Wa`alaykum As-Salaamu Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.In The Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:There is nothing wrong that one makes duaa for things of this world as long as one does not implore Allah to achieve something haram.In his response to the question, Dr. `Ajeel Jasem An-Nashmi, Professor of Shari`ah and former deputy chairman of the Kuwaiti Fatwa Committee, states:Every committed Muslim is required by Allah to make duaa and implore Him earnestly.Referring to this, Allah Almighty says, “And your Lord hath said: Pray unto me and I will hear your prayer. Lo! Those who scorn My service, they will enter hell, disgraced.” (Ghafir 40:60)During prayer, it is preferable to make duaa when prostrating and after reciting the last tashahhud. It is part of the Sunnah to recite the duaa using Qur’anic verses that contain supplications.If there is a Prophetic Hadith that contains a certain duaa formula, then it is not necessary to recite the exact words mentioned in the Hadith when reciting the duaa. There is nothing wrong in using words other than those mentioned in the Hadith.Muslim jurists have disagreed regarding the point you have raised concerning making duaa for worldly benefits in prayer.Both Malikies and Shafi`ies maintain that there is nothing wrong with making such duaa in prayer as long as one avoids making supplications to achieve something haram.On the other hand, the Hanbalis maintain that it is not permissible to make such duaa in prayer. The opinion, which is deemed to be the most correct is the one maintained by both Malikies and Shafi`ies as there is no specific evidence to prohibit it.It has become clear now that there is nothing wrong, as far as Islam is concerned, that one makes duaa for things of this world as long as one does not implore Allah to achieve something haram.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

Is There Zakah on the Money Saved for Hajj?								In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Hajj is not obligatory except on those who are able to perform it. This includes physical and financial ability.2- Therefore, Hajj is not obligatory on a person who is in debt. However, if a person has a long-term loan and he is required to pay only a certain amount each month, then his debt is only that which is due each month. If he pays off all the debt and then nothing is left with him to make Hajj, then Hajj is not obligatory on him. But if he pays the monthly dues and then has enough money to make Hajj, then he should make Hajj because it is obligatory on him.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Islam is built upon five pillars: testifying that there is no true god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, performing Prayer, paying the zakah, making the pilgrimage to the Sacred House (Hajj), and fasting the month of Ramadan.” (Al-Bukhari)Hajj is obligatory only on those who can afford it both financially and physically. It is crucial that the fare and provisions for this sacred journey be solely derived from lawful earnings, totally free of unlawful sources; it is equally important that they be free of all outstanding debts.Since you have accumulated arrears of student loans that are outstanding, you are not allowed to undertake the trip to Hajj. Your first priority is to pay your debtors. Hajj is obligatory only if you have enough resources remaining after paying them. So you should not consider Hajj unless you have come clean on your record of payment.The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) has warned us against performing acts of worship with tainted resources. We read in the Hadith: “Verily, Allah, the most Exalted, is Pure and He accepts only that which is pure; Verily, Allah commands the faithful with the same order He commands the apostles: ‘O Messengers! Eat of what is clearly halal and wholesome, and do good works.’” Then he mentioned (by way of illustration) the case of a man, who undertakes, after having traveled long distances, with disheveled appearance, and then raises his hands in supplication saying, ‘My Lord! My Lord!’ while his food comes from unlawful sources and his drink comes from unlawful sources, his clothes are from unlawful sources, and his entire body is nurtured by haram; so how would Allah answer his Prayer?.” (Muslim) Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date.Source: Excerpted, with slight modifications, from: www.muslims.ca "

Wa`alaykum as-salamu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear sister, let us express our sincere thanks to you for your eagerness to ask this question and we implore Almighty Allah to guide us all to His straight path!First, we console you and hope that Almighty Allah compensates you for this ordeal and grants you a righteous child. You have to know that this ordeal is a trail from Almighty Allah to test your faith and patience.The blood that is discharged after a miscarriage depends upon the status of the fetus. If the fetus was not shaped or the soul had not yet been breathed into it, then this blood is not considered nifas and thus, you have to wash it off, perform wudu’ (ablution) and pray.However, if the fetus was shaped or the soul was breathed into it, whether it was miscarried dead or alive, this blood is considered nifas and you should not pray till it stops. The creation and formation of the fetus, i.e., the appearance of human features, becomes apparent after eighty days after conception, as stated in the following hadith:The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said “The creation of any one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days, then he becomes a `alaqah (a piece of thick coagulated blood) for a similar period, then he becomes like a chewed piece of flesh for a similar period, then Allah sends an angel who is enjoined to write down four things, and it is said to him: ‘Write down his deeds, his provision, his lifespan and whether he is doomed for Hell or destined for Paradise. Then the soul is breathed into him.” (Al-Bukhari)In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:If your bleeding was not due to menses but it was due to miscarriage at such an early stage, then you should  perform salah; you simply need to wash yourself and perform wudu’ and pray. It should only be treated as nifas (postnatal bleeding) if it is preceded by birth. Since it was not due to birth, you can assume that it is not nifas.However, if the fetus has evolved and is fully formed then it should be treated as bleeding due to nifas.Allah Almighty knows best."

As regards your question, we would like to cite for you the following:Almighty Allah has blessed His servants by creating all kinds of provision on earth for them and He has permitted them to eat everything that is halal (permissible) and good.Allah says,“O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! He is an open enemy for you.” (Al-Baqarah 2:168)However, Allah forbids a limited number of foods that are bad and can be detrimental to one’s health.It is the duty of every Muslim to seek what is halal and keep away from haram not only as regards food but also in all the other affairs of his life.Monoglycerides and diglycerides are emulsifiers used in the food industry. Emulsifiers are food chemical substances which keep oil dispersed in water or water droplets dispersed in fat.They can be halal or haram depending on their source. Emulsifiers can be extracted from animals or plants.For example: gum Arabic, egg yolk (lecithin), mono and diglycerides, bile salts, soya bean, etc. are all sources of emulsifiers. Emulsifiers containing lecithin are OK for Muslims to eat. If the emulsifier is mono or diglycerides, you have to find out their sources.Recently, food manufacturers started labeling the source of mono and diglycerides. But if the source is not mentioned, then the only way to find out is to ask the bakery or the food manufacturer of the product that you want to consume.Moreover, there are several books about food ingredients, food additives, and preservatives in the West and their status in Islamic dietary laws.

This is to be added to whatever other Zakatable properties one owns and Zakah should be paid on the day of one’s annual Zakah.Regarding the second question, this land is purchased for the objective of sale for profit, so it is subject to Zakah.

In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear questioner, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake. May Allah reward you abundantly for your interest in knowing the teachings of your religion, Islam!One of the main causes of today’s disorder is the absence of justice. When justice disappears, it becomes no wonder to see oppression, corruption, occupation and terrorism reigning. So, applying justice is a key factor and necessary step towards restoring peace and security in the world.Islam gives special attention to this important principle. The Qur’an and Sunnah are abundant with provisions commanding Muslims to apply justice towards friends and enemies alike. Allah says “Allah does command you to render back your Trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man, that ye judge with justice.” (An-Nisa’ 4:58) He also says “Whenever you speak, speak justly, even if a relative is concerned.” (Al-An`am 6:152)Further, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) reports that Allah Almighty said: “O my servants! I have forbidden injustice for Myself and forbade it also for you. So avoid being unjust to one another” In addition, the Prophet tells us that among those shaded by Allah on the Day of Resurrection is “the just leader”.Delving deeper in this issue, Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi, president of the Fiqh Council of North America, stated in his Khutbah  at ISOC – Dhul Qi`dah 18, 1422/ February 1, 2002:Allah says in the Qur’an “We sent aforetime Our Messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war, as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that will help, unseen, Him and His Messengers: for Allah is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might (and able to enforce His Will).” (Al-Hadid 57:25)Establishing justice was the main mission of the Prophets of Allah. Muslims are urged in the Qur’an to live with justice and to carry on this prophetic mission in the world. In many places in the Qur’an Allah reminded the Believers and urged them to uphold justice for all people and under all circumstances. Allah says:  “O you who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest you swerve, and if you distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that you do.” (An-Nisa’ 4:135)In the following Surah, the same order is given in another way: O you who believe! stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just, for this is closest to Piety: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.” (Al-Ma’idah 5:8)What is Justice?Justice is described in the Qur’an with two important words: Al-`Adl and Al-Qist. Al-`Adl means “equity, balance.” It means doing things in a proportionate manner, avoiding extremes. Al-Qist means “share, portion, measure, allotment, amount.” It means that everyone and everything has a due. One who gives everyone and everything its due is “Muqsit” and the one who takes away others dues is called “Qasit”.Allah says: “… and be fair: for Allah loves those who are fair (and just).” (Al-Hujurat 49:9) and “But those who swerve, they are (but) fuel for Hell-fire.” (Al-Jinn 72:15)Justice thus means to maintain the balance and to give everyone and everything its proper due. It means living one’s own life in a balanced way maintaining the balance between the needs of the body, mind and soul. It also means recognizing:1. Huquq Allah – rights of God,2. Huquq Al-A`Ibad – rights of human beings, and3. Huquq Al-Ashya’ – rights of things.Islam teaches that we should be just in every aspect of our life, to all people and things and at all times.The opposite of justice in Islam is not only injustice, but oppression and corruption. The opposite of`Adl is Zhulm, which means “disorder, wrong, oppression and evil.” Wherever there is injustice, it will lead to oppression, exploitation, evil and corruption. There is a very nice saying of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” When people do injustice or tolerate injustice in one place, sooner or later its terrible effects reach to other places. Injustice brings the downfall of mighty nations. Imam Ibn Taymiah (d. 1328) used to say: “The nations may live long in spite of their disbelief, but they cannot live long when they do oppression.”Injustice in the world todayToday there is a lot of injustice in our world. There is social injustice, economic injustice and political injustice. There are problems of racism, religious prejudices and propaganda. The gap between the haves and have-nots is increasing. There are problems caused by poverty, hunger, malnutrition, death of children and diseases. There are problems caused by the denial of human rights, basic freedoms, occupation of lands, terrorism, wars, and weapons of mass destruction. We are living in a broken world. The hearts are broken, families are broken, relations are broken, homes are broken, cities and towns are broken.We need to heal this brokenness and it can only come by bringing justice to the world. There cannot be any peace without justice and there cannot be any justice without reforming our thinking, our behavior and our policies. It is strange that there is so much talk today about seeking safety and security, but very little about how to bring justice to those who are suffering under deep oppression and occupation. The world cannot be safe unless it becomes more just and fair world.The Role of MuslimsWe Muslims should play an important role in bringing justice to the world. We have to live by the guidance of Allah, establish justice and fairness among ourselves and be a good example to others. We should not only work for ourselves but for the whole world. We must remember that injustice cannot be removed by another injustice. We must love for others what we love for ourselves. We need to work and cooperate with others.Almighty Allah knows best.Excerpted, with slight modifications, from: www.isna.net"

In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. In this fatwa:1- A person’s dignity is so highly stressed that any aggression against his/her life is prohibited and the same degree of respect is given to his/her corpse after death.2- The Qur’an is clear that what humans are allowed to eat is animal meat not human meat.3- Islam forbids eating the meat of the dead, whether it is animal meat or human meat.4- Cannibalism is against civilization and is no more than a call for backwardness.In his response to the question in point, Sheikh `Abdul-Majeed Subh, a prominent Al-Azhar scholar, states: The general basic rule in Islam is that Islam only prohibits its adherents from what is bad and harmful and permits them to consume all that is good.Almighty Allah says: “He (the Messenger) will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul…” (Al-A`raf 7:157)In previous nations prior to the advent of Islam, prohibition was extended to some good things as a form of punishment because of their disobedience, as was the case with the Jews.Explaining this, the Qur’an states:“Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws. And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone. That We awarded them for their rebellion. And lo! We verily are Truthful.” (Al-An`am 6:146)The Qur’an is clear that what humans are allowed to eat is animal meat not human meat. The Qur’an is very clear about this fact as Allah says: “And the cattle has He created, whence you have warm clothing and uses, and whereof you eat.” (An-Nahl 16:5)The Arabic structure of the words ‘whereof you eat’ clearly explains that it is only the meat of livestock that humans eat, not that of humans.Of the above rule, the Qur’an excludes certain types of livestock and animal meat. Almighty Allah says: “Say (O Muhammad): I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh for that verily is foul or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than Allah. But whoso is compelled (thereto), neither craving nor transgressing, (for him) lo ! your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.” (Al-An`am 6:145)Also, Islam has forbidden the meat of carnivorous animals (i.e. those that prey on others and devour them such as the lion, leopard, wolf, etc. and birds with talons such as the hawk, eagle, falcon, etc.).Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) forbade the eating of any wild animal with a canine tooth and of any bird with talons.Modern science has proven the dangers of eating the meat of animals that live on meat.Here, I would like to move to Islam’s view of man as an honored creature. Almighty Allah says: “Verily We have honored the children of Adam. We carry them on the land and the sea, and have made provision of good things for them, and have preferred them above many of those whom We created with a marked preferment.” (Al-Israa’ 17:70)Slaughtering a human just like cattle is slaughtered has nothing to do with honoring this creature. Islam has made human life sacred and has safeguarded its preservation. It is forbidden in Islam to kill any human without any legal reason (such as in retaliation). The sanctity of man’s life in Islam is so stressed that once, while looking at the Ka`bah, `Abdullah ibn `Umar remarked, “How great and sacred you are! But the sanctity of the Believer is greater than yours.”In Islamic law, a murderer is to be killed for murdering any human regardless of the victim’s religion, status, position, race or color. This is because Islam honors and sanctifies human life whatever it may be.The practice of eating human flesh goes back to the centuries of backwardness. This call drags humanity back to the ages of ignorance and backwardness.It is a call for deviation from the track of human civilization in general, not to mention the teachings of religions. The claim that there is nothing in religion against this practice of eating human flesh is not true.The Islamic stand against cannibalism has been declared above.In Judaism it is prohibited to eat pork; then what should we expect that it teaches regarding eating humans? Being a follower of a certain religion or being with no religion does not qualify one to rule that there is nothing in all religions to prohibit cannibalism.Cannibalism is against civilization and is no more than a call for backwardness. If religions and scholars as well as politicians stand against human cloning, then all efforts should be mobilized against cannibalism and human slaughter.The eminent Muslim scholar and renowned Da`iyah, Sheikh `Abdel Khaliq Hasan Ash-Shareef, states: Eating the flesh of a dead body is forbidden in Islam with respect to the living beings which we are permitted to slaughter. And for greater reason, it is forbidden with regard to humans whom we are not permitted to slaughter or hurt.Islam forbids eating the meat of the dead, whether it is animal meat or human meat. The only meat that Muslims are permitted to eat is that of camels, cattle, sheep, and goats and non-preying birds, provided that the animal or bird is slaughtered according to the Islamic way of slaughtering.Hurting a human being is prohibited in Islam. Moreover, the sacredness of a human being and of his body after his death is the same as during his lifetime.Not only has Islam protected man’s dignity during his life but also it has guaranteed the protection of his honor after his death.Therefore, it commands washing, shrouding, and burying him, and forbids breaking his bones and all forms of aggression against his corpse, thus differing with the nations that cremate their people when they die.
This fact is stressed in the hadith of the Prophet which states, “Breaking the bones of a deceased person is like breaking his bones alive (in sin).”Man is not created to be eaten but to live and worship Allah. After death, man’s corpse is to be buried, which is a sign of the honor and dignity that Islam grants to humans.It is not permissible by any means to eat human flesh. Cannibalism has no place in Islam. It is an act against humanity and contradictory to human nature. It is no more than an indication of cruelty, barbarism, brutality that is an indication of abnormality and harsh-heartedness.Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

Among other things, they have based this ruling on a report attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) which states, “Neither those who are sexually defiled nor those who are menstruating shall read the Qur’an.” (Ibn Majah) A group of scholars belonging to Maliki, Shafi`i and Hanbali schools, and others, however, have rejected the above position. As has been pointed out by Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, there is nothing wrong for women to read the Qur’an either from their memory or from the mushaf itself, should they find it necessary to do so.Even some of those scholars who are generally in favor of disallowing menstruating women from reading the Qur’an from the mushaf have considered it permissible for them to do so if they are teachers or students or they are afraid of forgetting what they have memorized.Having cited the various views let me conclude by saying:Should there be dire necessity for you to do so, you are definitely allowed to read the Qur’an, either from your heart or mind, or by holding the Qur’an itself. If there is no such necessity, then you can definitely listen to the Qur’an, for there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever in the sources to indicate that listening to the Qur’an in the state of menstruation is forbidden.Therefore, you may listen to a recorded Qur’an without any inhibition; you may also read the du`aa’s (supplications) from the Qur’an at all times without incurring any sin whatsoever.Allah Almighty knows best.

Ex-Wife Against Teaching Islam to My Daughter								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Muslims are not allowed by any way to have physical relations with the opposite sex outside marriage.2- So, it is the duty of the Muslim families and societies to facilitate marriage, especially for those who are getting older than the normal age of marriage.3- If a man or a woman is forbidden from marriage for any a certain reason, he/she should observe abstinence and have patience asking Allah Almighty to get him/her rid of that obstacle.In his response to the question in point, Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi, former president of the Islamic Society of North America, states the following:It is a very sad thing to see that Muslim women or men suffer unmarried life due to un-Islamic social factors. We must blame our un-Islamic social customs and materialistic outlook that cause some men and women to remain unmarried.Some young people or their parents have very high expectations for their spouses. They set a very difficult standard of education, profession, wealth or physical features for any prospective suitor. The result is that such women remain single because the suitors fail to meet those standards.We, Muslims, must emphasize that the best criterion according to Islam is good character. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said, “If someone whose faith and morals you trust makes a proposal of marriage to you then marry him, otherwise there will be trials and much corruption in the land.” (Ibn Majah)As Muslims, it is also our duty to help our Muslim brothers and sisters get married. Allah Almighty says, “And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maid servants. If they be poor; Allah will enrich them of His bounty. Allah is of ample means, Aware.”(An-Nur 24:32)However, if for any reason men or women are not able to marry, then they must observe abstinence. They have no other way. Allah says that the believing men and believing women guard their private parts from committing any illicit sexual act.He Almighty says, “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do.”(An-Nur 24:30)He Almighty also says, “Lo! men who surrender unto Allah, and women who surrender, and men who believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth, and men who persevere (in righteousness) and women who persevere, and men who are humble and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women who guard (their modesty), and men who remember Allah much and women who remember Allah hath prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward.”(Al-Ahzab 33:35)Sexual relations are allowed only among the married couples. Sex outside marriage is not allowed in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said, “O young people, whoever among you can afford to marry, let him/her get married, because marriage protects the private parts of the body (i.e. from illicit relations) and it guards the eyes from straying. But those who cannot afford to marry then let them fast, because fasting will curb their sexual urge.” (An-Nasa’i)Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

May Allah save us all from the traps of Satan and enlighten our hearts with the light of Islam!Mosques in Islam have an integral role to play for the service of the community and the Muslim state. The role of the mosque is not confined to Prayer. Rather, it can be used for holding important public meetings, weddings, teaching the Qur’an, etc. While mosques cannot be used as a marketplace, the mosque’s premises that have a separate entrance can be used for such projects.In his response to your question, Sheikh `Abdul-Majeed Subh, a prominent Al-Azhar scholar, states,First of all, it should be clarified that it is not permissible to use the masjid as a marketplace for sale and purchase or things like that. However, if you are referring to the buildings attached to the mosque, there is nothing wrong with making use of such premises in conducting projects for the service of the community such as restaurants, shops, bakery, etc., as long as such projects are permissible.As for holding weddings, counseling, important gatherings, and the like in the mosque, such matters are absolutely among the messages of the mosque in Islam. Mosques in Islam can be used for discussing public matters that concern the Muslim community and state.In the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), the mosque was used for important gatherings that concerned the Muslim community. It was also used for all things related to the safety of the Muslim community. It was used for calling for jihad, collecting charities, calling for orphan care, etc.Moreover, the eminent Muslim scholar Sheikh `Abdel Khaliq Hasan Ash-Shareef adds,We have to differentiate between the masjid and its premises. The masjid is the place that is prepared for Prayer. It is not permissible to use it as a marketplace, bakery, restaurant, or the like. However, it can be used for teaching the Qur’an, giving lectures, and religious or scientific lessons, etc.As for the mosque’s premises, there is nothing wrong in making use of them in matters that are of benefit for the community.

In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:We have to abstain from consuming the flesh of the pork as well as any food that is fried in its oil, since pork is impure, and hence, it contaminates the oil in which it is fried.In his response to your question, Sheikh `Abdul-Majeed Subh, a prominent Azharite scholar, stated:Eating the flesh of pigs is forbidden in Islam as it is ordered in the Qur’an. Allah Almighty says:“Forbidden to you (for food) are carrion, blood, swine flesh, and that which has been dedicated to any other than Allah; that which has been strangled; that which has been beaten to death (by a blunt instrument); that which fell (a long fall); that which was gored by horns; that of which predators have eaten—saving that which you make lawful (by slaughtering before they die); and which has been sacrificed to idols.” (Al-Ma’idah 5:3)Almighty Allah says in the Qur’an:“Say: I do not find in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden for an eater to eat of except that it be what has died of itself, or blood poured forth, or flesh of swine– for that surely is unclean– or that which is a transgression, other than (the name of) Allah having been invoked on it; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring nor exceeding the limit, then surely your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.” (Al-An`am 6:145)Therefore, some scholars say that only the flesh of the swine is impure, so eating food that has been fried in the same oil in which pork has been fried, is permissible. The justification here is that Almighty Allah only mentioned its flesh as being forbidden in the verse.However, the majority of scholars are of the opinion that the entire body of the pig is forbidden; its flesh, bones, and fat. Therefore, we have to avoid eating any food that has been fried in the same oil in which pork has been fried.Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of  Toronto, Canada , added:We are not allowed to eat food that has been fried in the same oil in which pork or its by-products have been fried. It is clearly haram and we must not rationalize it.

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:No Muslim can use cannabis unless he is forced to consume it for medical reasons – under the strict prescription of a trained medical practitioner.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:According to scientific studies, using marijuana is proven to be deleterious to mental and physical health.Since Islam is a religion that stresses preservation of life, mind, and health as priorities, a Muslim cannot resort to it, or condone its use as it would be akin to suicide and self-destruction.The only exception would be medicinal use where there is no alternative; in which case it is permissible under the rule of ‘necessity lifts the prohibitions.’ Allah says,“Those who shall follow the [last] Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they shall find described in the Torah and Gospel that is with them, who enjoins what is right, and forbids them what is wrong, and makes good things lawful for them, and forbids them bad things (khaba’ith), and relieves them of their burden and the shackles that were upon them. Thus, those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light that has been sent down with him; it is they who shall prosper.” (Al-A`raf 7: 157)The word khaba’ith as used in the above verse refers all actions including consumption of foods and drinks that are forbidden because they are deemed filthy and impure.It is clear from another verse where Allah forbids the use of intoxicants:
“O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, and idols, and divining arrows are, but filthy (and loathsome) practices, of Satan’s work. So shun it, that haply you may prosper.” (Al-Ma’idah 5:90)
The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Everything that causes intoxication is wine, and hence all intoxicants are also forbidden.” (An-Nasa’i)Furthermore, while explaining the reasons for banning intoxicants and gambling, Allah says in the Qur’an:“They will ask you about intoxicants and games of chance. Say: “In both, there is great evil as well as some benefits for man, but the evil which they cause is greater than the benefit which they bring.” (Al-Baqarah 2: 219)Based on this, the rule of the Shari`ah is that a thing which has some benefits while having greater harm, it should be forbidden. This rule applies to wine, alcohol and all forms of intoxicants, including the use of cannabis.Let me cite here from the Government of Canada (health-Canada/services):“While cannabis may make you feel relaxed and happy, your body and brain may also experience effects that are: negative, unwanted, unpleasant, and some of the short-term effects on your brain can include…impaired ability to: remember; concentrate; pay attention; react quickly; anxiety, fear or panic.”“Short-term effects on your body can also include: if smoking damaged blood vessels caused by the smoke decreased blood pressure, which can cause people to faint increased heart rate, which can be dangerous for people with heart conditions and can lead to an increased risk of heart attack.”“Cannabis use can also result in psychotic episodes characterized by paranoia; delusions; hallucinations The long-term effects of cannabis on your brain can include an increased risk of addiction. Long-term cannabis use can also harm your: memory; concentration; intelligence (IQ); ability to think and make decisions.Other long-term effects of smoking cannabis are similar to the effects
of smoking tobacco. These effects can include risks to lung health,
such as bronchitis; lung infections; chronic (long-term) cough; increased mucus buildup in the chest.” (Health effects of cannabis)It is rather easy for us to conclude that the Quranic principle stated above prohibiting intoxicants and gambling applies to use of marijuana, as well.
Therefore, no Muslim can use cannabis unless he is forced to consume it for medical reasons – under the strict prescription of a trained medical practitioner.Almighty Allah knows best."

It is prohibited to dissever relations with your relatives.Answering your question, Dr. Mohammad S. Alrahawan, Associate Professor at the department of Islamic Studies in English, Al-Azhar University, Egypt, states:Maintaining a good relation with blood relatives is obligatory in Islam. It is prohibited to dissever relations with your relatives. We read in the Qur’an what means:{So would you perhaps, if you turned away, cause corruption on earth and sever your [ties of] relationship? Those [who do so] are the ones that Allah has cursed, so He deafened them and blinded their vision.} (Muhammad 47:22-23)It is not necessary that your relatives maintain their relations with you and your families in order to do good for them.Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Al-As (may Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “The person who perfectly maintains the ties of kinship is not the one who does it because he gets recompensed by his relatives (for being kind and good to them), but the one who truly maintains the bonds of kinship is the one who persists in doing so even though the latter has severed the ties of kinship with him”. (Al-Bukhari)Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Ties of kinship (rahim) are derived from the All-Merciful (ar-Rahman). They say: ‘My Lord! I have been wronged! My Lord! I have been cut off! My Lord! I have! I have!’ Allah answers them, ‘Are you not content that I cut off the one who cuts you off and I maintain connections with the one who maintains connections with you?'” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)Therefore, you do not have to make istikharah for things which are clearly prohibited. You have to maintain your good relations with them even if without exchanging visits.Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

What Should Be Done in This Great Month of Ramadan?								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- If your mother died immediately after her illness while she has not completely recovered in order to make up for the missed days of fasting, then there is no sin upon her, in which case you are not required to do anything.2- However, if she has recovered without making up for the days she missed, then you may either fast the days on which she broke the fast or feed a needy person two satisfying meals for each day.In this regard, Imam An-Nawawi, who is a Shafi`i scholar, states the following in his book Al-Majmu`:Scholars have different opinions regarding the person who misses some days of fasting because of illness or travel then dies without making up for them. The Shafi`i scholars are unanimously of the opinion that there is no sin on such a person. They further say that no one is to fast on behalf of him/her or feed needy persons for the days he/she missed.This is the opinion adopted by Imams Abu Hanifah, Malik and the majority of scholars. Moreover, Al-`Abdari says, “This is the opinion of all scholars except Tawus and Qatadah who say that a needy person is to be fed for every day that the person missed. They base their opinion on the fact that this person (who has died) cannot fast and thus he should have the ruling of old people.”Al-Bayhaqi and other scholars who follow, along with us, the Shafi`i school, refute that opinion (of Tawus and Qatadah) quoting the hadith from Abu Hurairah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stating that: If I order you to do something, then do of it as much as you can. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)They (Al-Bayhaqi and other Shafi`i scholars) further disapprove of the analogy those scholars have drawn with the case of Hajj. The Shafi`i scholars differentiate between the case under discussion and that of old people by the fact that the aged person is still liable for obligations which is not the case of the dead.Another Shafi`i scholar, namely Ash-Shirazi, states in his book Al-Muhadhdhab:If someone dies while he has missed fasting some days in Ramadan, his case should be considered. That is, if he has delayed fasting them because of a legal excuse which has continued until his death, then he is free from any liability, as it is an obligation which he could not fulfill until he died, so such a person is absolved from the responsibility of this legal duty.In his book Al-Mughni, Ibn Qudamah, a prominent Hanbali scholar, states,With regard to the person who dies while there are some days of Ramadan for which he has not made up, there are two cases:First, he may have died before being able to fast because there was no time for fasting, or for a legal excuse such as illness or travel, or because of being unable to fast. Such a person is absolved from any liability according to the majority of scholars. However, Tawus and Qatadah (as mentioned above) are of the opinion that a needy person is to be fed for every day that the dead person missed. According to them (Tawus and Qatadah), the dead person has missed days of obligatory fasting and thus needy persons are to be fed as an atonement for these days. They further regard such a person’s case in the same way as that of an old man who cannot observe fasting.On the other hand, the majority of scholars base their opinion on the fact that such fasting is a right of Allah which is obligated according to the Shari`ah, and such a person has died before being able to observe it, thus, this dead person is absolved from this right without being required to perform another obligation in place of it. This is the same as the case of not performing Hajj. Furthermore, the case of such a dead person is not to be compared with that of the old man who is originally obligated to perform that duty unlike the deceased.Second, such a person may have died after being able to observe the fast, in which case, a needy person is to be fed for every day that the dead person missed. This is the opinion adopted by the majority of scholars.Concerning the same issue, a prominent Muslim scholar states,If an ill or a traveling person dies while being in the same state of illness or travel, then they are not obligated to make up for the days they missed, for neither of them have been able to reach the time when they could have made up for the missed days. However, if an ill person recovers and the traveler reaches a place of residence, and then they die, then they are both considered liable to atone for the missed days in accordance with the period they stayed in good health (in case of the ill person) or in residence (in case of the traveler).The liability here can be discharged through either of the following two ways:First, one of the guardians of the deceased should fast on behalf of him/her. This is according to the hadith `A’ishah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) which reads, “Whoever dies while he ought to have fasted (the missed days of Ramadan), his guardian(s) should fast on his/her behalf.”(Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Al-Bazzar has reported the same hadith with the following addition: “…if he (the guardian(s)) wills.”Commenting on this hadith, Al-Haythami states in his book Majma` Az-Zawa’id, “This hadith is narrated through a good chain of transmitters.”Thus, the guardian(s) should fast on behalf of the deceased as a matter of doing good to the deceased, not as an obligation which the guardian must fulfill. This view is substantiated by the hadith narrated on the authority of Ibn `Abbas that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said, “O Allah’s Messenger! My mother died and she ought to have fasted one month (i.e., she missed one Ramadan); shall I fast on her behalf?” The Prophet replied in the affirmative and said, “Allah’s debts have more right to be paid.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)It is well-known that one is not required to settle the debts of others except as a matter of doing good. This is because one is not obliged to fulfill others’ duties, and thus one can – but is not obliged to – fast on behalf of the deceased, and by this fasting the deceased’s liability is discharged.Second, the deceased’s liability can be discharged also by feeding a needy person for every day the deceased has missed, for this fasting is regarded as a debt in the sight of Allah which must be fulfilled from the deceased’s estate, as Allah’s debt has more right to be settled. Some scholars stipulate that the deceased should have determined that in his/her will; otherwise, nothing of the estate should be given to the needy, for the estate in this case has become the right of the inheritors.However, the sound opinion is that the estate becomes the right of the inheritors after fulfilling the legacies the deceased may have bequeathed and/or settling his debts, and the money given for atonement is the right of the needy which must be paid.Allah Almighty knows best."

Wa `alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear brother in Islam, thank you for your question; we ask Almighty Allah to bless you and shower you with His blessings and guidance.A Muslim should be keen on adhering to Islam and to stay away from anything that, in one way or the other, may let him or her fall prey to haram. Riba is one of the most heinous sins in Islam regarding which Almighty Allah promised to wage war against those who deal with it.In his response to your question, Prof. Dr. Monzer Kahf, a prominent economist and counselor, stated,Dear brother, this is a typical riba contract. The benefit of staying in the house for a year is considered a full-fledged lease. Here we have a case in which you give a loan for a year and take your money back after that year ends trading that for making use of this additional property (the benefit of staying in the house for a year). This is exactly a loan for riba and the riba is the benefit of staying in the house without paying rent (called manfa`ah in Shari`ah terminology).This wrong situation can be made right only by paying the standard market rent — which is called ajr al-mithl (Arabic for: the rent of the equivalent) in Shari`ah terminology.Paying a symbolic amount (the USD 10 you mentioned) is nothing but cheating yourself into feeling that what you are doing is not haram. The difference between this symbolic amount and the real rent is riba that you are taking for the loan (in the form of your rent-free house).Please give the house back to the landlord together with the accumulated rent for the period for which you have already made use of the house. Or pay the standard rent for the whole period, past and future.Otherwise, there is riba in this transaction.Allah Almighty knows best."

All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:Selling the traffic accident sketch is prohibited even by agreement between the owner and the buyer.Answering your question, the General Iftaa’ Department in Jordan, states the following: The compensation to be received by the owner of the damaged car from the insurance company is a debt on that company, or on the party responsible for the accident.Selling the traffic accident sketch is prohibited even by agreement between the owner and the buyer because of the following reasons:
First: Transference of a debt for a sum is incurring usury (riba) because it is selling deferred money for advanced money, and it is a condition for the validity of this transaction that payment is made on the spot.`Umar narrated : “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as saying: Gold for gold is interest unless both hand over on the spot.” (Agreed upon)Second: The sold item is unknown in terms of amount and value, and the Islamic Shari`ah stipulates that it should be known.Third: There is gambling and gharar (uncertainty) since the buyer could make a profit or lose, and the Shari`ah prohibits such transactions.In conclusion, one who has sold the traffic accident sketch of his car in return for a certain amount of money should repent to Allah the Almighty and return that amount to the buyer, then collect the compensation from the insurance company. However, if he couldn’t return that money immediately, he remains liable for it until he pays it off.Almighty Allah knows best."

Do I Have to Cover in Front of My Christian Step-Son?								In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- It is to be stated that the main criterion for acts of worship to be accepted is that they are offered by or on behalf of a Muslim.2- If a non-Muslim offers prayer or prayer is offered on his behalf, it will not be accepted since he lacks the main pillar of faith, which is testifying that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.3- Being interested to know about Islam is not enough to say that a certain person is a Muslim.4- You cannot perform Hajj on behalf of your deceased non-Muslim father, simply because he doesn’t meet the main criterion for having the `ibadah (acts of worship) accepted.The prominent Muslim scholar Sheikh `Atiyyah Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, states:In fact, the acts of worship are not accepted from a non-Muslim or on his behalf because he lacks the intention and Islam.The basic criterion for acts of worship being accepted is that the one offering the act be a Muslim and have the intention to perform that certain act.Elaborating more on this issue, the late Sheikh Ibn `Uthaymeen, a prominent Saudi Muslim scholar, states:Muslim scholars unanimously agree that a non-Muslim is addressed with Islam, that is, commanded to believe in Islam. But what about the rulings of Islamic Shari`ah and the acts of worship and the like: Is he addressed with them? This issue needs explanation.If you mean by address that he is commanded to do them, the answer is “no” because he has to accept Islam first and then do such acts.For this reason, the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh to Yemen and said to him, “Call them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they accept that, then tell them that Allah has ordained five prayers (salah) to be performed every day and night.”Thus, non-Muslims are not commanded to perform Prayer (salah), and if they have performed Prayer without accepting Islam, their Prayer is null and unaccepted, for they have to embrace Islam first.But if you mean by address that they will be punished for not performing it, then the answer is “yes”, for they will be punished for not performing acts of worship even if they die while still non-Muslims.This is clear from the verse of Surat Al-Muddathir that tells us about the non-Muslims who will be asked the reason for their being among the residents of the Hellfire. They will say, “We were not of those who prayed.” (Al-Muddathir 74: 43)This means that they will be held accountable for not performing such acts of worship because they have essentially rejected Islam and thus will be punished for the general rejection of Islam and the rejection of every act of worship.Based on this understanding, we conclude that you cannot perform Hajj on behalf of your deceased non-Muslim father, simply because he doesn’t meet the main criterion for having the `ibadah (acts of worship) accepted.Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

In the same vein, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “A human being is deprived of livelihood due to committing a sin.” (Ahmad)On the basis of what is mentioned above, we state that there is no objection to observe fasting with the intention you specified in your question (i.e. have an easy exam).

I want to perform Hajj Tamattu, if Allah Almighty wills, on the seventh day of Dhul-Hijjah, i.e., Umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between. What should I say when I begin the rituals? Which is better, to shave the head or cut the hair after doing the Sa`i of Umrah? From where should I enter ihram for Hajj? Do I have to shave my head on the Day of Sacrifice, after stoning Jamrat al-`Aqabah?","Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:The one who enters ihram for Umrah, intending to follow it with Hajj Tamattu, can exit ihram, then he can go to Jeddah or elsewhere and enters ihram for Hajj.Answering your question, the Fatwa Center at Islam Q & A, states:Firstly:Hajj Tamattu means entering ihram for Umrah only during the months of Hajj – the months of Hajj are Shawwal, Dhul-Qidah and Dhul-Hijjah – so when entering ihram for it, one should say, “Labbayk umratan (Here I am for Umrah).”Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing Umrah of Tammatu,“When the pilgrim reaches the miqat, he should do ghusl as in the case of janabah (ritual impurity), and apply the best perfume he can find to his head and beard, then put on the ihram garments, an izar (lower garment) and rida’ (upper garment); it is preferable for them to be white and clean. Then he should say, “Labbayk`Umratan (Here I am for `Umrah).”There is no need for him to say that he is connecting it to Hajj, exiting ihram in between, because he has already formed the intention in his heart that he is going to perform Hajj. So he should say,“Labbayk`Umratan, Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk. Inna al-hamdw a’l-ni`mata laka wa’l-mulk, laa shareeka lak.(Here I am for `Umrah. Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).”Men should raise their voices when saying this, and it should be understood that no tree, rock or brick hears him but it will testify on the Day of Resurrection that he said this Talbiyah.What the Talbiyah means is responding to Allah Almighty because the word “labbayka” means: I am responding to You. He should continue reciting the Talbiyah until he begins the Tawaaf of `Umrah.When he reaches Makkah, he should do Tawaf and Sa`i for `Umrah, shave or cut his hair, and take off his ihram. Then on the day of At-Tarwiyah, the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah, he should enter ihram for Hajj only and do all the actions of Hajj. So, the one who intends Tamattu`Hajj performs a complete `Umrah and a complete Hajj.” (Al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri)The one who is performing Hajj Tamattu` enters ihram on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah from the place where he is staying. When he enters ihram for Hajj, he does the same as he did when he entered ihram for `Umrah, doing ghusl and putting on perfume. So he should form the intention to enter ihram for Hajj and say “Labbayka Hajjan (here I am for Hajj)”, then recite the well-known Talbiyah.The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:“With regard to the one who enters ihram for `Umrah from the miqat, intending to follow it with Hajj Tamattu`, when he has done `Umrah, he should exit ihram. There is nothing wrong with him going to Jeddah or elsewhere, and then entering ihram for Hajj from the place where he is staying after doing `Umrah.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Da’imah, vol. 2, 10/76-77)Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:“What is prescribed for the pilgrim who is not in ihram is to enter ihram on the day of at-Tarwiyah from the place where he is, whether he is inside or outside Makkah, or in Mina, because the Prophet (peace and blessingsbe upon him) instructed those who had exited ihram after `Umrah to enter ihram for Hajj on the day of at-Tarwiyah from the places where they were staying.” (Majmu` Fatawa IbnBaaz, 16/140)Secondly:As you are going to do Umrah on the seventh day (of Dhul-Hijjah), you should cut your hair after finishing Umrah, and not shave your head, so that some of your hair will remain for you to shave during Hajj.The Prophet (peace be upon him) instructed his companions, during the Farewell Pilgrimage, to cut their hair, because their arrival was on the morning of the fourth day of Dhul-Hijjah. This indicates that cutting the hair in this situation is preferable to shaving, and it is better so that the head can be shaved during Hajj.Thirdly:The actions on the Day of Sacrifice for the pilgrim who is doing Tamattu` are, in order: stoning Jamrat al-`Aqabah, offering the sacrifice, shaving the head or cutting the hair, Tawaf al-ifadah and Sa`i.This is the best way, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did. If the pilgrim does some of them earlier and others later, or he does some of them after the Day of Sacrifice, there is nothing wrong with that.The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to delay shaving the head until the last of the days of Tashreeq, but if the pilgrim delays it any longer than that, then he must offer a compensatory sacrifice, according to some scholars.

There should be no dancing or singing or the like of what is prohibited in Islam.Focusing on the question in point, the eminent Muslim scholar, Dr. `Abdul-Fattah `Ashoor, Professor of Exegesis of the Qur’an at Al-Azhar University, states:Spending efforts for the interests of people is greatly rewarded by Allah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said, Whoever is spending effort for satisfying his brother’s need, Allah will be satisfying his need …” (Al-Bukhari)Having stated this, you will be rewarded for the act you are going to do if your intention is for the sake of Allah and it is in accordance with the ethics and morals of Islam.Marriage is based on the free choice of both the man and woman, with due consent and approval of their parents. Nevertheless, it is ultimately up to them to decide whom to marry so long as they are religiously compatible.Organizing match-making gatherings is a good initiative and you will have a great reward for it, especially in the light of the prevailing conditions and environments in the Western countries where immorality and lewdness are so rampant that the relationship between a man and a woman is a personal relation and everyone chooses what he or she likes without any restrictions.So, you are commended for the act you are going to do, as it is in the interest of those Muslims living in that country.The gathering you are going to arrange should be based on the teachings of Islam. Of course, there should be no intoxicating drinks or unlawful food served.There should be no dancing or singing or the like of what is prohibited in Islam.Families, including sons and daughters, can attend this gathering while abiding by the Islamic dress without uncovering their awrah or being exposed to any corruption.They can be invited for lunch or dinner, and in this way those attendees can talk to each other in a good atmosphere away from disgraceful mixing and the prohibited acts that do not comply with the ethics and morals of Islam.Such a gathering would open the door to mutual acquaintance and approach. Thus, the door of the lawful marriage would be easy for those people.Almighty Allah knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

I Want to Marry a Muslim Girl								

 

I Can’t Forget My Non-Muslim Boyfriend								

 

A Guardian Refuses to Marry His Daughter Off: Can She Marry Herself?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear sister in Islam, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake.First of all, it is to be stressed that Islam does not encourage the interfaith marriages. The general rule of Islam is that Muslims should marry Muslims. A Muslim male or female should not marry a non-Muslim male or female. The only exception is given to Muslim men who are allowed to marry the chaste girls from among the People of the Book (Christians or Jews).However, a Muslim woman is better suited to a Muslim man than a woman of Christian or Jewish faith, regardless of her merits. This is because marriage is not based on fulfilling one’s sexual desires; rather, it is an institution. It aims to establish a home on the bases of tranquility, faith and Islamic morals. To fulfill this task, the whole family must apply Allah’s course and try to convey His message.It is obvious that Islam made it impermissible for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim with aim of keeping her away from things that may jeopardize her faith. In fact, Islam aims at protecting religion. To achieve this goal, it prohibits a Muslim from being involved in something that poses a threat to his religion. A Muslim woman will not feel that her religion is secure while being with a Jewish or a Christian husband especially as the majority of the People of the Book do not show due respect to our Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).Allah Almighty says: “And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! The guidance of Allah (Himself) is Guidance. And if you should follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor helper.” (Al-Baqarah 2:120)Given the fact that the husband is generally the head of the household, it’s not far-fetched for a non-Muslim husband to prevent his Muslim wife from performing some Islamic rituals which may seem a nuisance to him, for example, fasting, or even refraining from marital relations during the fast. As a result, he might force her to change her religion, and if she refuses, the situation may culminate in divorce.As for why Islam allows a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, it’s clear that every Muslim believes in Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them) and he holds all the Prophets of Allah in high esteem. Thus a Muslim finds no harm in his wife’s being a Christian or a Jew, for the spirit of tolerance Islam holds for other religions is ingrained in him.In his response to the question you raised, the eminent Muslim scholar, Sheikh Muhammad Al-Hanooti, member of the North American Fiqh Council, states,If Allah is the one who prohibits a Muslim woman from marrying a non-Muslim, then we as Muslims are supposed to believe it and to take it. As a matter of faith, you cannot become a Muslim unless you accept everything when it is ordained by Allah or carried out by his Messenger. The Qur’an says, “O Ye who believe! Put not yourselves forward before Allah and His Messenger…”(Al-Hujurat 49:1)If you ask about the benefits of not marrying a non-Muslim, we can count you many reasons. A man is the manager of his household. He will persecute his Muslim wife in many dos and don’ts. She can hardly guarantee that kind of operation. Moreover, marriage is an institution for elevating our levels of having a good Islamic life. Pleasing Allah is our number one goal. If a woman is married to a non-Muslim, maybe the only thing she will accomplish in her marital life is what is good for livestock.Shedding more light on the question, we’d like to cite the following part of the well-known book, The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam:It is haram for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man, regardless of whether he is of the People of the Book or not. We have already mentioned the saying of Allah, “…and do not marry (your girls) to idolaters until they believe…” (Al-Baqarah 2:221)And He said concerning the immigrant Muslim women: “Then if you know them to be Believers, do not send them back to the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them (as wives), nor are they lawful for them (as husbands).” (Al-Mumtahanah 60:10)No text exists which makes exceptions for the People of the Book. Hence, on the basis of the above verses, there is a consensus among Muslims concerning this prohibition.Thus, while a Muslim man is permitted to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a Christian or Jewish man. There are many sound reasons for this difference. First, the man is the head of the household, the one who maintains the family, and he is responsible for his wife. And while Islam guarantees freedom of belief and practice to the Christian or Jewish wife of a Muslim, safeguarding her rights according to her own faith, other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, do not guarantee the wife of a different faith freedom of belief and practice, nor do they safeguard her rights. Since this is the case, how can Islam take chances on the future of its daughters by giving them into the hands of people who neither honor their religion nor are concerned to protect their rights?A marriage between a man and woman of different faiths can be based only on the husband’s respect for his wife’s beliefs; otherwise a good relationship can never develop. Now, the Muslim believes that both Judaism and Christianity originated in divine revelation, although later distortions were introduced into them. He also believes that God revealed the Tawrah to Moses and the Injeel to Jesus, and that both Moses and Jesus (peace be on them) were among the Messengers of Allah who were distinguished by their steadfast determination.Accordingly, the Christian or Jewish wife of a Muslim lives under the protection of a man who respects the basic tenets of her faith, her Scripture, and her Prophets, while in contrast to this the Jew or Christian recognizes neither the Divine origin of Islam, its Book, or its Prophet (peace be on him).How then could a Muslim woman live with such a man, while her religion requires of her the observance of certain worships, duties, and obligations, as well as certain prohibitions. It would be impossible for the Muslim woman to retain her respect for her beliefs as well as to practice her religion properly if she were opposed in this regard by the master of the house at every step.It will be realized from this that Islam is consistent with itself in prohibiting the Muslim man to marry a mushrik (polytheist) woman, for since Islam is absolutely opposed to shirk (polytheism), it would obviously be impossible for two such people to live together in harmony and love.Allah Almighty knows best."

Ex-Wife Against Teaching Islam to My Daughter								Wa `alaykum as-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- Muslims are not allowed by any way to have physical relations with the opposite sex outside marriage.2- So, it is the duty of the Muslim families and societies to facilitate marriage, especially for those who are getting older than the normal age of marriage.3- If a man or a woman is forbidden from marriage for any a certain reason, he/she should observe abstinence and have patience asking Allah Almighty to get him/her rid of that obstacle.In his response to the question in point, Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi, former president of the Islamic Society of North America, states the following:It is a very sad thing to see that Muslim women or men suffer unmarried life due to un-Islamic social factors. We must blame our un-Islamic social customs and materialistic outlook that cause some men and women to remain unmarried.Some young people or their parents have very high expectations for their spouses. They set a very difficult standard of education, profession, wealth or physical features for any prospective suitor. The result is that such women remain single because the suitors fail to meet those standards.We, Muslims, must emphasize that the best criterion according to Islam is good character. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said, “If someone whose faith and morals you trust makes a proposal of marriage to you then marry him, otherwise there will be trials and much corruption in the land.” (Ibn Majah)As Muslims, it is also our duty to help our Muslim brothers and sisters get married. Allah Almighty says, “And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maid servants. If they be poor; Allah will enrich them of His bounty. Allah is of ample means, Aware.”(An-Nur 24:32)However, if for any reason men or women are not able to marry, then they must observe abstinence. They have no other way. Allah says that the believing men and believing women guard their private parts from committing any illicit sexual act.He Almighty says, “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do.”(An-Nur 24:30)He Almighty also says, “Lo! men who surrender unto Allah, and women who surrender, and men who believe and women who believe, and men who obey and women who obey, and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth, and men who persevere (in righteousness) and women who persevere, and men who are humble and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their modesty and women who guard (their modesty), and men who remember Allah much and women who remember Allah hath prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward.”(Al-Ahzab 33:35)Sexual relations are allowed only among the married couples. Sex outside marriage is not allowed in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said, “O young people, whoever among you can afford to marry, let him/her get married, because marriage protects the private parts of the body (i.e. from illicit relations) and it guards the eyes from straying. But those who cannot afford to marry then let them fast, because fasting will curb their sexual urge.” (An-Nasa’i)Allah Almighty knows best.Editor’s note: This fatwa is from Ask the Scholar’s archive and was originally published at an earlier date."

My Daughter Broke My Heart								

 

I’ve Never Been Attracted to My Wife; Shall We Divorce?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu waRahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.In this fatwa:1- A woman can ask for divorce through khul` by returning dowry to the husband.2- A woman can also put a condition in the contract of marriage to have the right to divorce herself.3- In most cases, divorce happens between a man and his wife and in most cases, they do not like to reveal the secrets of their lives in front of outsiders.Answering your question, Dr. Mohammad S. Alrahawan, Associate Professor at the department of Islamic Studies in English, Al-Azhar University, Egypt, states: If a Muslim girl does not accept a man proposing to her in marriage, such a marriage is not valid. It was narrated from Ibn Buraidah that his father said: “A girl came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: ‘My father married me to his brother’s son so that he might raise his status thereby.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) gave her the choice, and she said: ‘I approve of what my father did, but I wanted women to know that their fathers have no right to do that.’” (Ibn Majah).Islam granted a husband the right to dissolve the marriage by issuing a divorce. Prior to divorce, he must take all possible measures to reconcile any troubles ensuing between him and his wife by referring to arbitration.He is further prohibited from divorcing her during her menses. On the other side, a woman can ask for divorce through khul` by returning his dowry. She can also put a condition in the contract of marriage to have the right to divorce herself.This is permissible in Islam. In this case, a husband empowers her to take this decision on his behalf.Moreover, it is highly recommended that a husband seeks witnesses for his divorce, but if it occurs without having witnesses, it becomes valid.The reason Islam did not require witnesses for divorce because in most cases it happens between a man and his wife and in most cases they do not like to reveal the secrets of their lives in front of outsiders.Misusing or manipulating a right which Allah has given to man is a major sin in Islam and man will be held accountable before Allah on the Day of Judgment.Allah Almighty knows best."

Pregnant in Ramadan: To Fast or Not to Fast?								

 

What Must I Do About Fasts Missed During Pregnancy?								Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.Dear sister in Islam, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you place in us, and we implore Allah Almighty to help us serve His cause and render our work for His Sake.First of all, we’d like to state that abortion is forbidden in Islam whether it be in the early or late stages of pregnancy. The degree of sin incurred varies according to the stage of pregnancy, so that less sin would be incurred if the abortion took place during the early stages, while it becomes increasingly haram (forbidden) as the pregnancy advances. When the pregnancy reaches the 120th day, abortion becomes totally forbidden and is deemed a form of murder that results in compensation becoming liable.In his response to your question, Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a senior lecturer and Islamic scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, states:Abortion or termination of pregnancy is generally considered abominable, and therefore is haram since it involves interfering with the life process once it has started. There are, however, differences of opinion about the permissibility of abortion in special circumstances depending on the stage of pregnancy.1- There is a unanimous consensus among scholars that abortion is absolutely forbidden after 120 days from conception. This is the point when ensoulment (breathing of the soul into the embryo) takes place. To abort pregnancy from this point onwards is akin to committing infanticide, which has been condemned in the Qur’an. Scholars, however, have made a single exception to this rule: If continuation of the pregnancy and carrying it through to full term proves to be a risk to the mother’s life, abortion shall be considered permissible.2- Abortion after the end of the first 40 days from conception is consideredharam except in the following exceptional cases: a) If carrying the pregnancy to full term exposes the mother to unbearable health problems during or after delivery; 2) if, as determined by reliable medical practitioners, the child will be born with such physical and mental deformity as would deprive him or her a normal life. This decision must be based on the opinion of at least two reliable medical experts in the field.3- While many scholars consider abortion before the end of the first 40 days of conception asharam, a number of them, however, consider it as either permissible or at least not as haram.In conclusion, as Imam Al-Ghazali has observed, one is discouraged from tampering with the life process once it has started; the intensity of sin, however, varies according to how advanced the pregnancy is. Thus while it may be considered as less sinful in the very early days, it is considered as absolutely haram after the ensoulment.Coming to your specific case, if there is no medical necessity that compels you to seek an abortion, you are best advised to carry it through to full term. Meanwhile, turn earnestly and sincerely to Allah to ease your burden and pain and grant you patience and strength to surrender to His will. Allah has certainly promised to bring relief to all those who turn to Him for assistance. “Whoever remains conscious of Allah, He will grant him ease in his affair.” (At-Talaq 65:4) The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whoever consistently asks forgiveness of Allah, Allah will appoint for him a way out of every conceivable trouble and provide for him sustenance in ways he can never foresee.””Excerpted, with slight modifications, from: www.muslims.caEditor’s note: Try to make friends at the mosque with other young mothers. You might learn from them how to deal better with caring for two small children, and perhaps you can exchange babysitting time so that you get a break once in a while from the kids.Allah Almighty knows well."
