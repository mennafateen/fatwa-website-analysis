As per the hadith, the mahr of the holy wives and daughters of the holy Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was five hundred dirhams. In some hadith the quantity of mahr Fatmi is mentioned 480 dirham. The weight of five hundred dirhams as per the current gram is 1530.9g silver while the quantity of 480 dirhams is 1469.664g silver. You may learn the calculation of said weight in Indian rupees from the market.

Note: The mahr of Umm Habibah (رضى الله عنها) was 1100 dirhams. The nikah of Umm Habibah (رضى الله عنها) was performed by Najashi, the king of Habsha and he himself took the responsibility to pay it. (L)

You should perform obligatory salah of Isha behind Imam and avoid arranging separate jamaats in different floors of a mosque, though it is allowable to offer separate Tarawih in different floors of a mosque provided there is narrow place, no sound echoing, no chaotic situation etc, but it is undesirable (makrooh tanzihee). It is another matter if performed on account of little space, but it should not be made a custom. If you want to perform Tarawih separately, then also you must offer Isha salah with jamaat and choose any other suitable place out of a mosque for Tarawih.

	(Fatwa: 1323/1298/M=11/1438)

	 

	The seven plots which are with your mother if they are left by your deceased father then all the Shariah heirs shall have their shares in it. It is wrong for your mother to distribute them as per her own wish. It is wajib to give each heir his/her Shariah share. The mother is entitled to receive only eights share while remaining shares shall go to you and your three sisters, you shall have double of the sisters’ shares. If the sisters don’t want to take their shares, then they can first receive their shares and then give it to you. But in case your mother is the owner of the said seven plots and she wants to distribute them in her life then the best method is that all the children are given equal shares. However, there is no harm if some differences are made on reasonable basis and there is no intention to harm any heir.

(2) If the husband was in anger, and now saying he was angry, then divorce given in anger is valid?
(3) Is divorce given three times all at the same time saying words like ""I give you divorce, I give you divorce, I give you divorce"" is consider as one divorce or it is valid for three time divorce? And can a husband still take her wife back?","

(2) According to Hanafi Fiqh, talaq takes place in the state of anger as well.
(3) By giving three talaqs in a single meeting all the three talaqs take place. One cannot keep one’s wife with him after giving three talaqs without a valid halalah. It is mentioned in the holy Quran:

However, during your menses only read wazifah and then supplicate and don’t offer Salatul Hajah as it is not lawful for a woman to offer salah during her menses. Moreover, for suitable match some elders have suggested to read Surah Muzammil daily after Zuhar salah. However, Surah Muzammil should also be read only during the period you are free from menses not while experiencing menstruation cycle. May Allah arrange some suitable match for you!

	(2) Keep on reciting the following dua extensively in-shaAllah you shall be protected against evil eye:

And the person who is unable to wake up in last night or midnight, he may offer two or four raka?at with the intention of tahajjud after Isha prayer. Insha-Allah he shall get its reward.

Question:
(1) In the above situation, is the gift valid because my father did not give the actual or physical possession to Hinda as they were staying in same house? Even if they had made all legal papers of gift by notarizing by the advocate that Zaid gifted his share to Hinda. But Zaid continued to stayed in the same house till his death.

It is so mentioned in common books of Fiqh. Hence now after the death of Zaid all these things shall turn his inheritance and shall be divided among all his legal heirs.

If the women come out of their homes for some need they should cover their faces as well. It is not enough to only cover their head and wear loose garments. It is mentioned in the holy Quran:
يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاء الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ .....
O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they should draw down their shawls over them.
The verse speaks about Jalabeeb (plural of Jilbab) which is a long chuddar. Hadhrat Ibn Masaood (رضى الله عنه) said regarding the chuddar that it was worn over scarf (Ibn Kathir), while Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (رضى الله عنه) has explained it in the following way:
أمر الله نساء المومنين إذا خرجن من بيوتهن فى حاجة أن يغطين وجوهنن من فوق رؤوسهن بالجلابيب ويدنين عيناً واحدةً .
Almighty Allah has ordered Muslim women that if they come out of their homes for any need they should draw down their shawls and cover their faces and keep only one eye open (to see the way).

Imam Muhammad Seereen says that he asked Hadhrat Ubaidah Salmani the meaning of this ayat and asked the nature of Jilbab then he draw down his shawl from head and covered his face and kept his left eye open and explained it practically. (Maarif al-Quran 7:223) By the said tafsir, the ruling of hijab of face was learnt clearly.

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

	(Fatwa: 872/872/M=09/1437)

	Slaughtering is of two kinds: (1) Optionaland (2) Compulsory. The optional slaughtering means that the animal is in the control of the slaughterer and he slaughters the animal by laying it down facing the Qiblah. And the compulsory slaughtering means that the animal is not in the control of the slaughterer and thus it is not mandatory to slaughter it as per the sunnah method completely rather the animal is stabbed at any place by reciting Bismillah and blood comes out whether it is by some equipment or by hunting animals. The conditions and wajib acts of the optional slaughtering have been mentioned in your second fatwa. But as far as the ruling pertaining slaughtering the animals by modern equipment and machines is concerned, it carries some details. Since the forms of machine slaughtering are different hence they carry different rulings. What is the method of slaughtering the animals by machines in gulf countries you should have mentioned it and then submitted the query. However if you are able to understand by reading then we refer you the book “Fiqhi Maqalat” written by Hadhrat Mufti Taqi Usmani Saheb. There is a chapter in volume 4 entitled: “Jadid Alat Se Zabah Karne Ke Tariqe and Hukm”. Study the chapter and if your query is solved then it is ok; otherwise ask your question again and seek a fatwa from us.

Whether it was a mosque or dargah, the dream indicates that those who are preparing to get clean and worship Allah, they are busy preparing for the hereafter, whereas people are generally indifferent towards the hereafter. By the old man in dream also your attention was drawn to the hereafter, so that you can enlighten your heart by keeping yourself in the company of the pious ones and follow the Shariah. Also, seeing your brother blind in dream indicates his indifference towards the hereafter; therefore it serves as special warning to strictly follow the Shariah, draw attention to the hereafter.

(1)    We do not know Abdul Wahab and Sheikh Faiz. If you write some details then we can reply. Your two practices mentioned in the question are right while the practice of your friend is not right.
(2)    Those who regard the Ahadith as hujjat shariyah (legal authority) and follow the path of Sahaba were named as Ahl al-Sunnat wa al-Jama?ah. This title became popular and famous for Ahl Haq true followers of Islam just after the age of Sahaba. Some people who are diverted from the path of Ahl Haq, but pretend to be from Ahl al-Sunnat wa al-Jama?ah, they give this impression that only they are from Ahl al-Sunnat wa al-Jama?ah not others. Moreover they call others with the title of Wahabi. While the Ulama of Deoband have firm enough in following sunnah and in following the footprints of Sahabah in their precept and practice and abstaining from innovation and obscenity is their characteristic sign. Thus in the real sense of term, these people and those follow their way are true Ahl al-Sunnat wa al-Jama?ah.

Undoubtedly going to graves in order to seek help from dead is shirk (associating partner with Allah): قال الشامی: انہ ظن أن المیت یتصرف فی الأمور اعتقادہ ذلک کفر [الشامی: 3/427]
 
But, if the help is sought from Allah it may be allowed but having such a belief about mazar (that they are places where prayer is accepted, or traveling to it) is baseless. This kind of belief is not proved by the Quran and Hadith; therefore it should be avoided, especially in this age when the mazaraat have become hubs of sins and innovations and where men and women meet together and do many acts of shirk.

The interpretation of your dream is that Allah Ta?ala wants to select you to achieve piety, purity, transparent life, follow sunnah and Shariah and pursue the high morals of fitrah. This is the interpretation. There is warning too that you do not have pursuit in following the Shariah and firmness as much you should have. You should pay attention to fulfil this requirement. Study Bahishti Zewar, Hayatul Muslimeen, Fazail Amal and read them out for each other, in-shaAllah you will get much benefit.

when i do istinja for urinating, i am forced to also clean my back passage because that is where the urine splashes usually fall.
my question is, when i do istinjaa, the water i use for istinjaa falls to the bottom of the toilet(which has already been flushed so the water in it is not dirty) and water splashes back on me. Would that water be najis? Since i heard if the water's smell/taste  doesent change, it is pure. the water in the toilet doesent seem to change, so is the water splashing back pure?

First night’s dream: I saw I am in Makkah and I felt like it is my home town and I saw some of my British friends over there. I was happy to see them revert to Islam but upon asking them they told me they came as tourist and didn't revert to Islam! It was really unpleasant dream.
Second dream: In dark night I saw a crow flying from far and landing straight on my finger and I was feeding it. It would not leave me even if I tried to throw it away. It was glued to my fingers.

What do you mean by 'solving the problems'? Only Allah Almighty has the sole power to harm and benefit anyone. It is the duty of man to adopt the sources; one of the strongest sources is praying to Allah. One can himself pray to Allah as well as request others to pray for him, both the ways are Sunnah. Therefore, one should keep reciting Quranic verses and duas of Hadith promising expansion in livelihood. As per the Shariah, it is also lawful to write these duas as taweez. If the mentioned Aalim gives taweez from Quranic verses, duas of Hadith, then one can take and use them. 
But, if there are other modes for solving problems, you should ask him and write them in detail and submit the question again.

But in case you cannot arrange for suitable income source then in such a case continue your present job and keep on doing taubah and istighfar. Also keep on looking for suitable job and when you get one leave this job.

	And if as per the rules (bylaws) of Indian Air Force there is no restriction on growing beard rather you enjoy religious freedom of each type and there is no ban in adopting your religious customs as it is written in Indian Constitution, yet the department does not allow you to grow the beard then you should consult any expert advocate and materialize the religious freedom mentioned in the Indian Law.

The Owner of the company does not reside in the company compound, and he spends a lot of time out of the country. Outside the compound nearby, there is a masjid (8-10 minutes walking distance) where 5 times namaz takes place with Azaan, and Jumma prayers aswell. The question is Mufti saab, does the Masjid in the company have the right to conduct Jumma Namaz, is the Jumma namaz accepted under the above circumstances? ","
بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم
(Fatwa: 1770/1385/L=1430)
 
The Fuqaha (Islamic jurists) hold the view that in a city where offering jum?ah prayer is allowable it is also allowed to conduct it in several places. Since, one of the main purposes of jum?ah prayer is to demonstrate magnificence which can obviously be obtained by offering in one place with large crowd. Hence, it is advised not to conduct jum?ah prayer in company?s mosque, when there is a mosque on ten minutes? walking distance, where jum?ah prayer is held. You should perform jum?ah in that mosque.

http://www.darulifta-deoband.com/home/en/Nikah-Marriage/21539,"Assalamualikum, Janab, This has reference to question No. Question ID#:19707 and on being asked to narrate in detail about how the marriage was held I am writing this e-mail. I, Khondakar Abul Basar, aged 34 years, had a registry marriage on 18th September, 2005 on Sunday at 2.30 P.M. in a Registry Marriage Office at Memari, West Bengal. In that marriage, I was alone present as bridegroom and I had no one to be witness of mine in marriage. The girl had her father, mother, maternal uncle and an old relative with her. We all sat in a single room with the Marriage Registrar and a Maulana Sahib who read marriage khodba. After reading marriage khodba the Maulana Sahib simply asked me two times and the marriage registrar one time about the Izaz Kabul and then the Maulana Sahib asked the girl three times about Izaz and Kabul directly which we both responded affirmatively and accepted. But, he never asked about any witness. When I asked I had no witness from my side, he said not required. But, he never asked anyone to be witness and give witness. When asked he said as the boy and the girl with her relatives sat in a single room, there is no need of any witness. The marriage was solemnized at the Mehr of Rs.10,000/- which I paid latter. As, there was no role of witness which is required in a marriage according to Islamic View, is this marriage legal in Islamic view? Before, Izaz ?Kabul we both signed in the marriage register and the three relatives of the girl signed as witnesses. Now, my question is whether the marriage was right according to Islamic view? As I was alone and no one had given any witness of mine whether this is acceptable? If this marriage is not legal what is to be done now? ","

As it had been written in the previous ID no. 19707 that it is not necessary to have a witness specially from you but when in the meeting of nikah two Muslim men or more were present who heard ijab-o qabul (exchange of nikah words), then the nikah took place. Therefore, in the question mentioned your nikah took place and your marriage was alright.

If you have squabbled with parents, you should seek their forgiveness. In future, if any matter drags you to have a discussion with them, you should talk to them with wisdom and politeness. In case they do not reply to your questions in a clear way, then also you should not treat them harshly, it is haram to misbehave the parents or to hurt them, instead you should pray saying: O' Allah have a mercy on them the way as they looked after us in our childhood. However, if they commit a mistake you should forgive them.

There is no sin if cats pass in front of you while you are offering salah. Animals are not bound by Shariah. But if you think that they would make the ja-namaz (prayer mat) dirty, and they would disturb if they crawl around you, hence it is better for you to offer salah in such a place free from their interference.

	Animals and birds that don’t prey with their canine teeth and claws and generally their diet is halal and pure then those animals and birds are halal. So it is mentioned in Fiqh books. And since neither I have seen emu bird nor know its details so if the emu bird seems to be halal as per the definition mentioned above then it shall be halal after slaughtering on Shariah method and the oil prepared from its fat will be halal and pure. So it shall be lawful to apply it on the body etc. and if it is slaughtered on non-Shariah method then halal bird will become haram due to slaughtering on haram method. Thus in this case the oil prepared with the fat will not be halal and pure and subsequently its use will not be lawful i.e. it will be impure.
